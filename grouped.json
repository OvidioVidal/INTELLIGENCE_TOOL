By\nleveraging cutting-edge technology and collaborative innovation, we're\nsetting the stage for a new era of connectivity and efficiency in the\nindustry. This venture underscores our commitment to not only advancing our\nproducts but also paving the way for sustainable and intelligent\ntransportation solutions.\"\n\nCoretura will be led by a four-member Executive Management team consisting\nof two members from each of the shareholders.

Its\ncloud-based platform was the first to establish a managed float pool\nspanning multiple hospitals and regions.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Locum’s Nest to the Aya family of brands and are\nenergized by the opportunity to transform healthcare staffing around the\nworld through innovation, technology and purpose,” said Emily Hazen, CEO of\nAya Healthcare.\n\nLocum’s Nest has built a reputation as a trusted technology partner to the\nNHS by relentlessly focusing on the needs of its healthcare customers.\nSince its founding in 2016, the company has helped pioneer the use of\ntechnology to enhance the welfare and working experience of the NHS\ncontingent workforce. At the heart of this innovation is its\ndigitally-powered float pools which enable NHS Trusts to work together\nseamlessly across regions, share workforce capacity, and support staff with\nflexible, well-matched shifts. This approach not only drives efficiency and\ncost savings but also fosters a more sustainable and compassionate\nworkforce model across the NHS.\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Aya in advancing our collective mission to\nimprove healthcare worldwide,” said Dr. Nicholas Andreou, co-founder of\nLocum’s Nest. “Aya’s resources and expertise will help us grow faster,\ninnovate more boldly, and ultimately make a greater difference.”\n\nLocum’s Nest will continue operating under its own brand, with a steadfast\ncommitment to supporting the NHS and the healthcare professionals who power\nit. “As part of the Aya family, we have the scale and infrastructure to\ntake that mission nationwide - immediately, whilst investing in the\nprinciples and partnerships that have defined us from day one,” said Dr\nAhmed Shahrabani, co-founder of Locum’s Nest.\n\nAya Healthcare is the largest healthcare talent software and staffing\ncompany in the United States. Aya operates the world’s largest digital\nstaffing platform delivering every component of healthcare-focused labor\nservices, including travel nursing and allied health, per diem, permanent\nstaff hiring, interim leadership, locum tenens and non-clinical\nprofessionals.

These include the strategic review that resulted in the\ndevelopment of the Company's 10-year strategy, Berkeley 2035; the\nidentification and appointment of high calibre new Board members; the\nindependent investor perception study that has helped shape the proposals\ncontained in today's announcement; and further changes to benefit the\neffective operation of the Board.\n\nAt this time, the Board is very conscious of the complexity of today's\noperating environment in our industry, the role of housing in the\nGovernment's growth agenda and the importance of the current executive team\nto maintaining Berkeley's unique business model and culture to drive\nlong-term value for shareholders, while also recognising the need to\nformulate and execute a successful succession strategy.\n\nReflecting this, and after careful consideration, it is proposed that Rob\nPerrins should be appointed as Executive Chair to succeed Mike as Berkeley\nembarks upon its new 10-year strategy.\n\nRob has been Berkeley's CEO since 2009 and has overseen a period of\nexceptionally strong performance and value creation. He has deep industry\nknowledge to lead through a period of complex regulatory change; respected\nworking relationships with today's political leaders; and an inherent\nunderstanding of the Company's business model, culture and values, to\nfoster the commitment of the senior leadership team through this period of\ntransition.\n\nAppointing Rob as Executive Chair will provide assurance to key\nstakeholders, including our people and the leaders in National and Local\nGovernment, of the continuity in leadership needed at this time. It\nresolves succession in a way that retains the Berkeley culture and values,\nthe importance of which is recognised by shareholders and other\nstakeholders alike. While giving clarity to all over the future of the\nsenior leadership team, it also paves the way for emerging talent.\n\nAs required by the UK Governance Code, Rachel Downey, the Senior\nIndependent Director will consult with major shareholders in relation to\nthis proposal.\n\nOn Rob becoming Executive Chair, Richard Stearn will become CEO. Richard\nhas been Berkeley's CFO since 2015 and therefore has a strong understanding\nof the industry and Berkeley's business model. His appointment will uphold\nBerkeley's longstanding tradition and preference for promoting from within\nwhich maintains the culture and values of the organisation and provides\ncontinuity and stability for the Company, our people and shareholders. It\nis intended that these appointments would become effective from the\nconclusion of the AGM.\n\nOnce the consultation process has been completed, any further Board changes\nwill be announced, including the appointment of a new CFO, a role for which\nthere are strong internal candidates who have been with Berkeley for a\nnumber of years.\n\nOther Non-Executive changes\n\nWilliam Jackson has announced his intention not to seek re-election at the\nSeptember AGM.  The Board would like to thank William for his strategic\ninsight and extensive contribution during his tenure.\n\nThe Company is delighted to announce the appointment of Richard Dakin to\nits Board as a Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of the AGM.\nRichard has had a long and distinguished career in banking, capital markets\nand real estate through both his executive roles, most recently as Head of\nCBRE's European investment banking and debt and structured finance business\nand, prior to that, as Managing Director and Head of the Real Estate\nbusiness support unit at Lloyds Bank, and as a non-executive director at\nDerwent London plc.\n\nThe Company is well advanced with the appointment of a further high\ncalibre, non-executive director with extensive industry and public company\nexperience, anticipated to be announced early in the New Year.\n\nRob Perrins, Chief Executive, said: \"On behalf of the Board, I would like\nto thank Mike for his significant contribution to Berkeley over the last\nthree years and in particular his leadership in the development of the\nBerkeley 2035 strategy. The Board is stronger for his period of leadership.\nI would also like to thank William for his contribution to the Board and\nadvice over his tenure.  We wish them both the very best in the future. I\nam delighted to welcome Richard Dakin to the Board.  Richard brings with\nhim many years of directly relevant experience and will be a fantastic\naddition.\"\n\nMichael Dobson, Chairman, said: \"Berkeley is a Company with a proud and\ndistinct heritage and a great deal of potential. It is an honour to have\nplayed a role. Rob has been a great Chief Executive for 16 years and I wish\nhim and the Company all the best for the future.\"\n\nLink to Exchange Announcement (\n )\n\nLink to Earnings Report (\n )",

        "body": "sponsor\n\nItalian manufacturer Eurmoda is set to double its turnover with two\nstrategic acquisitions expected to close this year, Piero Migliorini,\npartner at its sponsor Aurora Growth Capital, told Mergermarket.\n\nThe company, which produces metal accessories for the luxury industry, has\na \"very ambitious\" growth plan and a \"very rich\" acquisition pipeline,\nMigliorini said, and will “proceed step by step, to choose the right moves\nto compete, also through strategic M&A opportunities.”\n\nEurmoda expects its turnover to reach around EUR 90m once it closes the two\ndeals, Migliorini said. The company is already in exclusive talks about the\nfirst acquisition, a specialist steel-accessories producer, he said, adding\nthat this deal has just entered due diligence.\n\nThe undisclosed target is a “very high-performing company from a financial\npoint of view”, he said. Last year, it generated around EUR 20m in revenue\nwith a 20% EBITDA margin, demonstrating double-digit growth, he said.\n\nThe target is a strong strategic fit for Eurmoda; it operates in a highly\nspecific sector and supplies a primary luxury company that is not currently\na Eurmoda client, giving it \"exceptional\" appeal, he said. The deal is\nexpected to close as soon as this year, he added.\n\nThe second acquisition, for which negotiations are \"very advanced\", is a\nSpanish company operating in metal processing for the bijoux sector,\nMigliorini said. This target, which generates around EUR 10m revenue, would\nallow Eurmoda to diversify its client base by connecting with a new type of\ncustomer, and to have a presence in the jewellery sector, he said.\n\nEurmoda will fund such acquisitions using a combination of its own\nresources and contributions from the new partners supporting its growth, he\nsaid.\n\nAt the beginning of June, Aurora Growth Capital signed a binding agreement\nto acquire (\n)\napproximately 50% of Eurmoda. Following the transaction, which is expected\nto close by the end of July, existing shareholder Mindful Capital Partners\nwill hold a 27% stake in the business, along with founder and CEO Marco\nVecellio and Auro Macuz, while other minority investors will completely\nexit.\n\nThe two ongoing acquisitions alone are projected to boost Eurmoda's\nfinancial standing, Migliorini said. The company could grow this year from\nits current EUR 60m in revenues with EUR 10m EBITDA to around EUR 90m in\nturnover and EUR 17m in EBITDA, he said.\n\n“This is a tremendous growth for a sector that is generally suffering,” he\nsaid, adding, however, that as a strategic supplier to the high-end segment\nof the luxury market, Eurmoda has not experienced difficulties.\n\nBeyond the immediate targets, Aurora Growth Capital maintains a rich\npipeline of companies that can complement Eurmoda's accessory offerings, he\nsaid.\n\nThe company projects strong organic growth next year, building on 2025,\nwhich is expected to close in line with 2024, Migliorini said, adding that\nEurmoda expects 2026 revenue “in the order of EUR 110m-EUR 120m”.\n\nEurmoda specialises in manufacturing metal accessories, primarily for\nleather goods such as handbags and belts, which account for around 90% of\nits revenue, as reported (\n)\nby this news service. Its past acquisitions include Italian peers Alce, ABC\nMorini and Macuz, as reported.\n\nBased in Pederobba, near Treviso, Eurmoda has around 360 employees, and\nproduction plants in Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany.\n\nby Micaela Osella",

        "body": "Several major infrastructure investors have submitted non-binding offers\nfor a minority stake in the German division of Dutch transmission grid\nowner TenneT, according to sources.\n\nA tie-up of CPP Investments and Iberdrola, advised by Barclays, filed an\noffer ahead of yesterday’s deadline (\n)\n, as did Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, advised by JPMorgan, the\nsources added.\n\nA consortium comprising Dutch pension fund APG, advised by RBC, and Norges\nBank Investment Management is also among the bidders. Their joint\nparticipation in the TenneT sale comes after the consortium withdrew from\nthe sale of RWE’s stake in Amprion, another large German grid operator in\nthe market, the sources explained.\n\nCopenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), CDPQ and Allianz are also said by\nsources to have filed non-binding offers for TenneT, in a process that will\nrequire incoming investors to commit up to around EUR 4bn of investment.\n\nThe deal will involve the new investor acquiring new shares rather than\nthose of the existing shareholders.\n\nTenneT’s German arm generated EBITDA of about EUR 3bn in 2024, according to\ncalculations by S&P.\n\nGiven the scale of the transaction, sources said that Lazard and ABN AMRO,\nthe sellside advisors, are giving flexibility to the bidders to join forces\nat a later stage, if they decide to do so.\n\nSources added that while CIP filed an offer that entails it investing less\nthan EUR 4bn, this flexibility means it could still advance in the process\nby joining a consortium.\n\nAfter the collection of NBOs, the next crucial step in the process is the\nupcoming decision by the Dutch government, TenneT’s owner, on moving ahead\nwith the sale or pursuing a partial initial public offering for the\nbusiness instead.\n\nThis decision is expected to be formally announced in July, as laid down in\nMay in the recent letter sent to the parliament by Dutch Finance Minister\nEelco Heinen.\n\nTenneT is one of Germany’s four transmission grid operators alongside\n50Hertz Transmission, TransnetBW and Amprion.\n\nLast month, the asset management subsidiary of German lender Commerzbank,\nCommerz Real, acquired an indirect share of around 4.5% in Amprion.\n\nOther recent deals in the sector saw German utility EnBW selling a 24.95%\nstake in TransnetBW to a consortium led by local insurance group SV\nSparkassenVersicherung, for around EUR 1bn.\n\nThe buyer agreed to pay around EUR 1bn for the stake, an EnBW spokesperson\nconfirmed to Infralogic.\n\nInvesting in transmission grid operators offers a significant growth\nopportunity, but also large capital requirements.\n\nAmprion has vast investment plans totalling some EUR 35bn over the next\nfour years, much of which is due to be funded by equity, to cover upgrades\nto accommodate increasing renewables penetration and growing electric\nvehicle use.\n\nWhile such investment places large financial demands on investors, it also\nholds the prospect of strong returns underpinned by government support for\nthe energy transition.\n\nAPG, Barclays, TenneT, JPMorgan, GIC, Norges and CPP declined to comment.\nIberdrola, Allianz, CDPQ and CIP did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nby Nick Roumpis and Stefano Berra",

Bagnall held 25.35 per cent.\nof DORE's issued ordinary share capital (excluding any shares held in\ntreasury) as at the Latest Practicable Date (and is eligible to vote at the\nGeneral Meeting but not at the Court Meeting). Bagnall was established in\n2013, and its principal activity is to invest in the acquisition,\ndevelopment and operation of energy generation and infrastructure assets,\nand to make loans to energy and infrastructure businesses through its\ntrading entities. Bagnall aims to preserve capital and deliver a steady\nreturn to its investors through income generation and capital appreciation.\nDowning LLP (the \"Investment Manager\") acts as discretionary investment\nmanager to Bagnall and also provides certain administrative services to\nBagnall. The Investment Manager also acts as investment manager to DORE.\n\n·          In accordance with the requirements of Rule 29 of the Code,\nAppendix 4 to this announcement contains a valuation report in respect of\nDORE's portfolio of renewable energy infrastructure assets from Forvis\nMazars LLP confirming the valuation as at 31 March 2025 prepared by the\nInvestment Manager in connection with the 31 March 2025 NAV published by\nDORE on 20 June 2025. The valuation report will also be included in the\nScheme Document.\n\nBackground to, and reasons for, the Acquisition\n\n·          Bagnall is a long-term private investor with a diverse portfolio\nof investments in renewable energy infrastructure assets. Bagnall has\nsignificant experience in the renewable energy infrastructure sector as it\nis already a substantial investor in solar power, wind power, hydropower\nand battery storage across the UK and Northern Europe. Bagnall has invested\nin renewable energy infrastructure assets since 2013 and its portfolio\ncontains 8,649 renewable generation assets across 118 holdings.\n\n·          The Bagnall Board believes that renewable energy infrastructure\nwill be one of the most impactful and lasting investment themes in the\nforeseeable future, and DORE's renewable energy infrastructure assets are a\ncompelling long-term investment opportunity that enhance portfolio\ndiversification, and enable investors to capitalise on the growing\nrenewable energy sector. Alongside these benefits, renewable energy\ninfrastructure assets help to reduce the impact of climate change through\nthe generation of clean electricity, appealing to investors who are\nconscious of the environmental and the social impact of their investments.\n\n·          As DORE's largest shareholder since DORE's IPO, the Bagnall\nBoard is pleased by the progress made by DORE so far under the management\nof the Investment Manager. However, the adverse macroeconomic backdrop\naffecting DORE and many other alternative funds in the UK investment trust\nsector has resulted in DORE's shares consistently trading at a discount to\nDORE's NAV per share since the end of September 2022. The Bagnall Board\nbelieves that there can be no certainty or expectation that this discount\ncan be materially reduced or for the DORE Share price to exceed the Offer\nPrice in the medium-term.\n\n·          The significant and persistent discount to NAV over the past 12\nmonths has prevented DORE from issuing new shares to reach a more\nmeaningful scale, and has deterred buyers in the secondary market. The\nBagnall Board believes that DORE's lack of scale currently presents a\nstructural disadvantage and may impact DORE's efficiency and appeal, with\nhigher operating costs reducing net returns for investors, limited\nliquidity deterring institutional investors and a lack of scale restricting\nDORE's ability to make new acquisitions. All of these factors may further\nhinder DORE's efforts to address its persistent discount to NAV.\n\n·          The Bagnall Board wishes to maintain and increase Bagnall's\nexposure to DORE's portfolio and strategy and believes that DORE will\nachieve greater success as a private vehicle. The privatisation of DORE\nwill also deliver immediate value crystallisation to DORE's existing\nshareholders. Bagnall is well placed to support DORE's existing portfolio\nas both companies have been managed by the Investment Manager since\ninception.\n\nBackground to, and reasons for, the DORE Directors' recommendation of the\nOffer\n\n·          DORE has returned one of the highest NAV total return rates\n(including dividends reinvested) in the listed renewable energy\ninfrastructure sector over the last three years to 31 December 2024. Since\nIPO, DORE has generated a NAV total return (including dividends reinvested)\nof 36.2 per cent. to 31 March 2025 (inclusive of the Q1 DORE Dividend\nannounced on 20 May 2025), equivalent to an annualised NAV total return of\n7.1 per cent., against the medium-term target of 6.5 to 7.5 per cent. per\nannum set out at DORE's IPO.\n\n·          The DORE Shares began trading at a share price discount to NAV\nfrom the end of 2022, prompting the DORE Board to initiate share buybacks\nin March 2023 as part of a broader effort to narrow the discount, which\nculminated in a significant buyback programme returning £12 million to\nshareholders, equivalent to approximately 7.9 per cent. of DORE's issued\nshare capital at the time the programme commenced.\n\n·          Despite these efforts and the Investment Manager's successful\nexecution of the investment strategy, DORE has continued to experience a\nprolonged dislocation of its share price from its NAV per share and NAV\nperformance. During this period, UK-listed alternative investment trusts\nhave experienced widening share price discounts to NAV, owing to elevated\ninterest rates, weaker investor sentiment, fund reallocation away from\nalternative assets, and declining asset valuations. As at the Latest\nPracticable Date, the market capitalisation weighted average share price\ndiscount to NAV in the UK-listed renewable energy infrastructure sector was\napproximately 27 per cent., significantly wider than the sector's market\ncapitalisation weighted average share price premium of approximately 10 per\ncent. at the end of December 2020, shortly after DORE was launched.\n\n·          The DORE Board believes that the negative impact of the external\nheadwinds on the renewable energy infrastructure sector has at times\ndisproportionately affected DORE's share price discount to NAV given DORE's\nsmall size, relatively low trading volumes, and lack of ability to issue\nnew shares.\n\n·          In March 2025, DORE received an unsolicited indicative all-cash\nproposal from Bagnall regarding a possible offer for the entire issued, and\nto be issued, ordinary share capital of DORE not already owned by Bagnall.\nFollowing negotiation between the parties, the terms of the proposal were\nrevised and improved.\n\n·          In assessing the Offer, the DORE Board considered DORE's\nprospects as a standalone subscale investment trust, feedback from major\nshareholders, and Bagnall's position as DORE's largest shareholder.\n\n·          As the DORE Board retains its confidence in the Investment\nManager and DORE's strategy, in the absence of the Acquisition, which is at\na material premium to the share price, the DORE Board would be inclined to\nrecommend to shareholders that DORE continue in its present form. The DORE\nBoard believes that DORE's share price discount to NAV does not fairly\nreflect the DORE portfolio's value, performance or longer-term prospects.\nHowever, it also acknowledges that various risks and uncertainties, many of\nwhich are beyond DORE's control, are likely to persist in the short to\nmedium-term. These factors may continue to weigh on the future share rating\nand, by extension, shareholder returns.\n\n·          In reaching its conclusion, the DORE Board has considered that\nthe Offer Price of 102.6016 pence per DORE Share represents a 23.62 per\ncent. premium to the Closing Price of 83.00 pence per DORE Share on 19 June\n2025 (being the Latest Practicable Date) and a 7.46 per cent. discount to\nthe Ex-Dividend 31 March 2025 NAV. The DORE Board considers the Ex-Dividend\n31 March 2025 NAV to be a more appropriate comparator to the Offer Price\nthan the 31 March 2025 NAV which includes the Q1 DORE Dividend.\nAccordingly, following careful consideration of the above factors, the DORE\nBoard has concluded that the Offer is in the best interests of DORE's\nshareholders as a whole.\n\nRecommendation\n\n·          The DORE Directors, who have been so advised by Singer Capital\nMarkets as to the financial terms of the Offer, consider the terms of the\nOffer to be fair and reasonable. In providing its advice to the DORE\nDirectors, Singer Capital Markets has taken into account the commercial\nassessments of the DORE Directors. Singer Capital Markets is providing\nindependent financial advice to the DORE Directors for the purposes of Rule\n3 of the Code.\n\n·          The DORE Directors intend to unanimously recommend that Scheme\nVoting Shareholders vote (or procure the vote) in favour of the Scheme at\nthe Court Meeting and DORE Shareholders vote (or procure the vote) in\nfavour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting (or, in the\nevent that the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, to\naccept or procure acceptance of the Takeover Offer), as they have\nirrevocably undertaken to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings\nof, in aggregate, 401,085 DORE Shares, which represent, in aggregate,\napproximately 0.23 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of DORE\n(excluding any shares held in treasury) and approximately 0.31 per cent. of\nthe Scheme Voting Shares (being those Scheme Shares eligible to vote at the\nCourt Meeting), in each case as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\nIrrevocable undertakings and letters of intent\n\n·          Bidco has received commitments and indications of support for\nthe Acquisition from DORE Shareholders in respect of 28,526,111 DORE\nShares, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 16.76 per cent. of\nDORE's issued ordinary share capital (excluding any shares held in\ntreasury) and approximately 22.54 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares, in\neach case as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\n·          These commitments and indications comprise irrevocable\nundertakings in respect of 13,850,934 DORE Shares, which represent, in\naggregate, approximately 10.94 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares and\nnon-binding letters of intent in respect of 14,675,177 DORE Shares which\nrepresent, in aggregate, approximately 11.60 per cent. of the Scheme Voting\nShares, in each case as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\n·          The irrevocable undertakings include irrevocable undertakings\nreceived from each of the DORE Directors who hold DORE Shares to vote (or\n(ii) in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting\n(or, in the event that the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover\nOffer, to accept or procure acceptance of the Takeover Offer) in respect of\ntheir entire respective beneficial holdings of Scheme Shares. In aggregate,\nthis represents 401,085 DORE Shares, being all of the DORE Shares currently\nbeneficially held by such DORE Directors and approximately 0.31 per cent.\nof the Scheme Voting Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\n·          These commitments and undertakings also include irrevocable\nundertakings received from T.Choithram & Sons, Human Capability Foundation\nand Downing Sustainable Investments I, and non-binding letters of intent\nfrom Hawksmoor Investment Management, FS Wealth Management and Tyndall\nInvestment Management, in each case to vote (or to procure the vote) (i) in\nfavour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and (ii) in favour of the\nResolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting (or, in the event that\nthe Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, to accept or\nprocure acceptance of the Takeover Offer) in respect of their entire\nrespective beneficial holdings of Scheme Shares. In aggregate, such\nirrevocable undertakings represent 13,449,849 DORE Shares and approximately\n10.63 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares as at the Latest Practicable\nDate. The non-binding letters of intent represent, in aggregate, 14,675,177\nDORE Shares and approximately 11.60 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares\nas at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\n·          Further details of the irrevocable undertakings (including the\ncircumstances in which they may lapse) and the non-binding letters of\nintent are set out in Appendix 3 to this announcement.\n\nConditions, timetable and valuation report\n\n·          It is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by way\nof a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies\nAct. However, Bidco reserves the right to elect (with the consent of the\nPanel and subject to the terms of the Co-operation Agreement) to implement\nthe Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer.\n\n·          The Acquisition will be subject to the Conditions and certain\nfurther terms set out in Appendix 1 to this announcement and to the full\nterms and conditions that will be set out in the Scheme Document. The\nConditions include, amongst other things: (i) the approval of Scheme Voting\nShareholders at the Court Meeting and the passing of the Resolutions at the\nGeneral Meeting; (ii) the sanction of the Scheme by the Court; (iii) the\nScheme becoming Effective by no later than the Long Stop Date; and (iv)\ncertain regulatory clearance conditions, as set out in paragraphs 3.1 - 3.4\nof Part A of Appendix 1 to this announcement.\n\n·          In order to become Effective, the Scheme must be approved by a\nmajority in number of Scheme Voting Shareholders representing at least 75\nper cent. of the voting rights of Scheme Voting Shareholders, in each case\npresent and voting, either in person or by proxy, at the Court Meeting and\nat any separate class meeting which may be required by the Court or at any\nadjournment of such meeting.\n\n·          It is expected that the Scheme Document, containing full details\nof the Scheme and notices of the Court Meeting and General Meeting,\ntogether with the Forms of Proxy, will be sent to DORE Shareholders within\n28 days of this announcement (or such later time as DORE, Bidco and the\nPanel may agree).\n\n·          Subject to the satisfaction or, where applicable, waiver of the\nConditions, it is expected that the Scheme will become Effective in the\nthird or early in the fourth quarter of 2025. An expected timetable of\nprincipal events relating to the Acquisition will be provided in the Scheme\nDocument.\n\n·          For the purposes of Rule 29.1(d) of the Code, a valuation report\nin respect of DORE's portfolio from Forvis Mazars LLP confirming the\nvaluation as at 31 March 2025 prepared by the Investment Manager in\nconnection with the 31 March 2025 NAV published by DORE on 20 June 2025 is\nset out in Appendix 4 to this announcement and will also be included in the\nScheme Document (or, if applicable, the Offer Document). For the purposes\nof Rule 29.5 of the Code, the DORE Board confirms that Forvis Mazars LLP\nhas confirmed to it that an updated valuation of DORE's portfolio of\nrenewable energy infrastructure assets as at the date of this announcement\nwould not be materially different from the valuation as at 31 March 2025\nconfirmed by Forvis Mazars LLP in the valuation report set out in Appendix\n4 to this announcement.\n\nCommenting on the Acquisition, Hugh Little, DORE's Chair, said:\n\n\"DORE has consistently delivered on its investment strategy resulting in a\nstrong NAV and dividend performance since IPO. Despite this, and the\nproactive steps taken by the Board to narrow its share price discount in\nrecent years, the sustained horizon of economic and macro uncertainty has\nweighed on the share price, which has also limited the opportunities for\nfurther raising of new capital, and which may stretch into the mid to\nlong-term. The Board of DORE considers the certainty of the offer by Bidco,\nat a significant premium to the closing share price, to be fair and in the\nbest interest of shareholders.\"\n\nCommenting on the Acquisition, James Watson, Bagnall's Chair, said:\n\n\"We are firm believers in the transformative power of renewable energy\ninfrastructure, and the acquisition of DORE aligns perfectly with Bagnall's\nlong-term vision and commitment to the sector. However, given challenging\npublic market conditions and DORE's current lack of scale, we believe that\nthe acquisition will enable it to achieve greater scale, success and\noperational efficiency. For too long, DORE's true value has not been\nreflected in its share price, and today's offer represents an attractive\nopportunity for DORE Shareholders to immediately crystallise value.\"\n\nLink to source (\n )",

        "body": "Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal may sell his majority stake in\nMetro Bank after receiving investor interest, a newswire reported.\n\nReuters, citing multiple sources close to the situation, reported that\nGilinski, who owns 52.87% stake in Metro Bank via Spaldy Investments, is\nexploring options for his holding, including a sale.\n\nThis consideration follows a rebound in the bank's share price. Gilinski\nbecame the majority shareholder after a pivotal role in Metro Bank's GBP\n325m equity recapitalization in 2023.\n\nAccording to two sources, private equity firms Pollen Street Capital and BC\nPartners jointly submitted a bid for Metro Bank in recent weeks. However,\nthey halted their efforts following a valuation dispute and the board’s\ndecision to reject their proposal, the report added citing one of the\nsources.\n\nOne potential option for Gilinski is expanding Metro Bank through a merger\nwith another lender, the item noted.\n\nMetro Bank ended Thursday’s trading with its shares priced at 125.8 pence\neach, bringing its total market capitalization to GBP 844m.\n\nA potential acquisition by Pollen Street and BC Partners, who own British\nspecialist lender Shawbrook, might have resulted in a merger between Metro\nBank and the specialist lender. The firms had previously considered a bid\nfor Metro Bank in 2023, the report concluded.\n\nMetro Bank, Pollen Street Capital, BC Partners, and a representative of\nGilinski declined the newswire's comment request, while there was no\nresponse from Shawbrook to the newswire's request for comment.\n\nLink to original source.

        "body": "tomorrow's champions\n\nAmid a muted dealmaking environment, Unigestion is doubling down on backing\nhungry and entrepreneurial emerging champions that want to revitalise and\ninnovate the future of private equity, Kim Pochon, global head of primary\ninvestments told Mergermarket.\n\nUnigestion boasts over 30 years of experience backing hundreds of early\nmarket entrants and holds a legacy of investing in EQT’s and Francisco\nPartners’ first funds.\n\nIn 2019, it launched a dedicated Emerging Manager Choice (EMC)\nfund-of-funds programme to address growing LP demand for differentiated\nprivate equity strategies and improved fund economics.\n\nThe Switzerland-headquartered manager held a EUR 275m first close (\n)\nlast month for its EMC III offering, representing more than two-thirds of\nits EUR 400m target, as per its press release.\n\n“We’ve always believed returns and innovation come from newly set-up\nmanagers,” Pochon said. Roughly 40% of Unigestion’s primary commitments are\nallocated to emerging managers, which it defines as sponsors in Fund I or\nII, Pochon said.\n\nThe EMC strategy is sector-agnostic, and Unigestion seeks spin-outs from\nestablished, hard-to-access GPs, as well as sector specialists applying\ndifferentiated strategies.\n\nUnigestion’s approach to manager selection typically centres around\nidentifying experienced investment professionals setting up their own shops\nwho are highly incentivised to succeed. “When you back a Fund I, the\nalignment is very pure. If it fails, there’s no plan B,” Pochon said.\n\nLP fatigue for large-cap players\n\nEven in a tough fundraising climate, interest in emerging managers remains\nbuoyant, said Pochon.\n\nMany LPs, particularly institutional types, have grown disillusioned with\nlarge-cap managers’ muted liquidity and returns in recent years. They have\nincreasingly tended to have a more positive perception towards mid- and\nlower-mid market names, he said.\n\n“A lot of LPs told us it made sense to go back to private equity’s roots:\nhungry, nimble, entrepreneurial fund managers,” Pochon said.\n\nThe sponsor has also fielded strong interest from LPs seeking access to\ntomorrow’s flagship managers. “Our LPs know that by partnering with us,\nthey can build relationships with the next breakout GPs before they’re\noversubscribed,” he added.\n\nGeographically, EMC III’s first close was dominated by European\ninstitutional investors, though Unigestion also saw strong appetite from\nfamily offices and expects further international diversification by final\nclose.\n\nThe sponsor will typically target four to five commitments a year through\nthis vehicle, aiming for 12 to 15 managers over EMC III’s three-year\ninvestment period. It will split its US and European deployment on a\nfifty-fifty basis.\n\nFund III has already started deploying, but Pochon declined to disclose how\nmany managers have been backed so far or what ticket sizes were involved.\n\nBacking innovation with better alignment and terms\n\nBeyond strategy differentiation and alignment, Unigestion is also able to\nnegotiate favourable terms from emerging managers, who often offer lower\nmanagement fees, reduced carried interest, or preferential co-investment\nopportunities.\n\n“We’ve cracked the code,” Pochon said. “Even with a fund-of-funds\nstructure, our total expense ratio is comparable to a normal direct fund\ncommitment.”\n\nTo effectively compete in this challenging fundraising market, the firm has\nalso invested in and encouraged managers to consider launching\nshort-duration funds, which are vehicles with seven-year fund lives. While\ninvestments are often more concentrated and the asset holds are shorter –\nwithin the range of two to three years – one great exit can repay the fund,\nand the fee benefits are meaningful, Pochon said.\n\nPochon said they encourage fund managers to slash – sometimes by half –\ntheir fundraising target and invest in a lower number of companies.\n\n“This requires a different type of due diligence, but the fee benefit is\nthere. And, when the portfolio’s more concentrated – and we’ve seen a lot\nof success with this – one very strong exit can repay the entire fund,” he\nsaid.\n\nAside from short-duration funds, the EMC platform can also target\nco-investments and late primaries.\n\nAs for what makes a high-conviction pick, Pochon distilled it to a simple\nwith an established GP in this strategy? More often than not, the answer is\nyes, because no one else is doing what they’re doing.”\n\nUnigestion launched its first pure-play emerging manager fund – EMC I – in\n2018 and followed this with the launch of EMC II in 2022.\n\nLast February, the manager announced (\n)\nthat EMC II had reached its final close and its first exit. The fund was\nalready 50% deployed and was likely to comprise 80-100 underlying companies\nthrough 10-12 fund investments, complemented by 10-15 direct co-/secondary\ninvestments, according to its press release.\n\nAt the time, EMC II was already delivering on its no J-curve promise, the\nfirm said, having exited its J-curve six months after its first close and\nposting a TVPI of 1.46x gross (1.42x net) at the final close.\n\nUnigestion, founded over 50 years ago, manages (\n)\nUSD 15bn in assets as of March 2025. Its key private equity strategies are\nin secondaries, directs, emerging managers, climate impact and tailored\nsolutions.\n\nAmong private equity names it has backed in the past are Hg Capital’s\nMercury funds, Vance Street Capital, Integrum, Vidia, ArchiMed and BlackFin\nCapital Partners.\n\nby Kezia Kho",

          "Seeks to expand LP base beyond mostly-France in future"
        ],
        "body": "Although private equity is investing more in European deeptech, its “timid”\nforay is not creating sufficient capital for companies in the sector to\nscale-up, managing partner Pierre-Emmanuel Struyven and investment director\nat Supernova Invest Michaël Thomas said.\n\n‘Deeptech’, or ‘deep technology’, companies offer innovative solutions\nbased on groundbreaking scientific research. The sector can refer to\nartificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, as well as quantum\ncomputing, biotechnology or robotics.\n\nWhen Supernova was established in 2017, it was one of the few European\ndeeptech pure-players in the venture capital market alongside Omnes Capital\nand Jolt Capital, Struyven said.\n\nNew players have progressively emerged, but they mostly focus on funding\nearly-stage companies, he said.\n\nThe goal is now to support future market leaders, but that requires more\nexits to materialise, one of the major issues faced by deeptech investors\ntoday, he said.\n\nA key challenge for early-stage investors is finding buyers or additional\ninvestors for their investments at the necessary multiples, Thomas said. An\nissue especially relevant considering the limited capital from larger funds\nflowing into the sector.\n\nThe “classic” M&A deal is not the only path, he said, adding that larger\nfunds could join the capital structure and replace early-stage investors on\nthe board.\n\nHe named Exotec, a French robotics company, and AI expert Dataiku as\ncompanies that saw larger funds taking over historic venture capital\ninvestors.\n\nIn 2022, Exotec raised (\n)\nUSD 335m in a Series D round which valued the business at USD 2bn and led\nby Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nThe same year, Dataiku (\n)\nsecured USD 200m in a Series F funding round led by new investor Wellington\nManagement, at a USD 3.7bn valuation.\n\nFifteen deals to go\n\nThis February, Supernova raised EUR 100m for its early-stage deeptech fund\nSupernova Innovation 3, the successor of EUR 75m vehicle Supernova 2,\nStryuven said.\n\nSupernova’s historic investors - CEA Investissement, Crédit Agricole,\nBpifrance, bioMérieux, Vinci and Michelin - are among Supernova Innovation\n3’s LPs, he said. The vehicle also attracted MACSF as a new investor, he\nsaid, adding that around 70% of the fund’s EUR 100m hard cap came from\ninstitutional investors.\n\nThe firm aims to expand its LP base, which is mostly French today, to the\nbroader European market, Struyven said.\n\nSupernova started to market its fund in mid-2023, Struyven said, adding\nthat the vehicle’s LPs were attracted by the firm’s investment strategy,\nits deeptech expertise and track record.\n\nSupernova Innovation 3 will pursue around 20 deals, Struyven said. It will\ndeploy in seed or Series A funding rounds and reinvest on average twice in\nthe same business, he added.\n\nThe vehicle will pursue two to three deals annually and deploy EUR 1.5m-EUR\n2m initially, and up to EUR 7m per portfolio company in total, he said.\n\nIt will target European businesses, he said, adding that Supernova has\ninvested in France, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, Denmark, Belgium and\nIsrael. Over the last 18 to 24 months, Supernova invested as much in France\nas in the rest of Europe, Thomas added.\n\nSupernova Innovation 3 has already invested in five companies: quantum\nmicroelectronics expert Quobly (\n)\n, maker of small molten salt reactors Stellaria, producer of bioelectronic\ndevices Discure Technologies (\n)\n, vision correction therapy expert Allotex (\n)\nand lithium power provider Wattalps (\n)\n.\n\nProfitability is not the only criteria\n\nSupernova deploys in spacetech, digital tech, cleantech, industrial tech\nand healthtech, Struyven said.\n\nIt has lately looked into several software-enabled hardware, including\nphysical AI and autonomous robotics, Thomas said, adding that the firm\ninvested (\n)\ninto Zurich-based ANYbotics, an AI-focused robotic inspection solutions\ncompany, last December.\n\nWhen it comes to pure-player software providers, Supernova is attentive to\ncloud-based, cybersecurity and vertical AI solutions, which are software\nplatforms tailored for a specific industry, he said.\n\nThe AI market is “quick” and very capex-intensive but Supernova is keen on\ninvesting in the sector and has done so with Gleamer (\n)\nin June 2023, he added.\n\nOn average, Supernova aims to exit a company after five to seven years when\nit entered during a seed funding round or Series A, and between three to\nsix years after a Series B, Thomas said.\n\nThe firm aims for a two-digit IRR for this vehicle that is well above 10%,\nStruyven said. Profitability adds value to a company, but it is not the\nonly criterion for investors looking for strong growth, which is reassuring\nfor the venture capital market, Thomas added.\n\nSupernova has more than EUR 800m assets under management (AUM) and plans to\nreach EUR 1bn AUM next year, Struyven said. It has invested in around 100\ncompanies in total, he added.\n\nIt also has an agrifood fund, launched in 2023, which has carried (\n)\nout three investments so far with a fourth underway, he said, declining to\ngive further details.\n\nThe firm has 33 people, including about 20 among its investment team, he\nsaid.\n\nby Myriam Mariotte in Paris",

At an extraordinary meeting, the\nSupervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG today approved the Executive Board’s\nplans to spin off of a minority interest in TKMS. The positioning as a\nstand-alone listed company should boost the competitiveness and growth\nopportunities of TKMS in the long term.\n\nThe plans involve consolidating the marine business under a new holding\ncompany and transferring 49 percent of the TKMS shares to the shareholders\nof thyssenkrupp AG in proportion to their interest in thyssenkrupp AG. This\nwould make the shareholders of thyssenkrupp AG direct shareholders of TKMS.\nThrough the spin-off, 51 percent – and hence the majority interest – of\nTKMS remain with thyssenkrupp AG. TKMS thus remains a fully consolidated\ncompany in the thyssenkrupp Group. The shareholders of thyssenkrupp AG will\nbe asked to approve the plan at an extraordinary general meeting on August\n8, 2025. The aim is to finalize the listing of TKMS on the Frankfurt Stock\nExchange within this calendar year.\n\nProf. Siegfried Russwurm, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp\ntechnologies. The Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG is convinced that\nTKMS will be best able to exploit the huge growth potential as a global\npioneer in the maritime defense industry as an independent entity. We\ntherefore recommend that the shareholders of thyssenkrupp AG approve the\nspin-off of TKMS at the extraordinary general meeting.”\n\nAs the world market leader for non-nuclear submarines, TKMS is one of the\nleading system providers in the maritime defense industry. With an order\nbacklog at a record level of around 18 billion euros, production at the\ncompany will be at full capacity well into the next decade. The long-term\ngeostrategic developments also provide the company with further growth\nopportunities that will be best leveraged through this independence.\n\nThe planned spin-off is consistent with the group’s strategic realignment.\nthyssenkrupp AG is basically aiming in the medium term to become a\nstrategic holding company with autonomous units, while retaining majority\nstakes in the businesses. Similar steps were already taken in the past,\nsuch as floating the hydrogen subsidiary thyssenkrupp nucera on the stock\nmarket.\n\nFuture strategic target model for the further development of the group\npresented\n\nAt the extraordinary meeting of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board\nof thyssenkrupp AG also presented the current status of its future\nstrategic target model for the further development of the group as a whole,\nparts of which had become known prematurely in May. The main goal of this\nstrategy is to gradually turn all business units at thyssenkrupp into\nindependent companies and open them up to third-party involvement.\nImportant steps toward this goal have already been taken with the spin-off\nof a minority interest of Marine Systems at a well-advanced stage and the\ninitiated efforts to create a 50/50 joint venture of Steel Europe with EPG.\n\nOver the coming years, efforts will be made to achieve capital market\nreadiness for the Materials Services and Automotive Technology segments as\nwell and then to make them independent. The relatively young Decarbon\nTechnologies segment is also to be made independent in the future, as soon\nas the necessary requirements have been met and the market for green\ntechnologies permits it. thyssenkrupp AG basically intends to retain a\nmajority stake in the businesses once they have achieved capital market\nreadiness. The goal is to form a focused, agile, and realigned industrial\nindependent businesses.\n\nContract for CEO Miguel Ángel López Borrego extended by five years\n\nAt today’s extraordinary meeting, the Supervisory Board also agreed to\nextend the contract of the CEO of thyssenkrupp AG, Miguel Ángel López\nBorrego, by five years until May 31, 2031. Mr. López’s current contract\nends at the end of May 2026.\n\nyears, Miguel López has pursued the strategic realignment of thyssenkrupp\nwith tremendous energy and clear objectives, and made important progress.\nThat applies in particular to the initiated restructuring and the\n20-percent stake of EPG in thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, the spin-off of\nMarine Systems at a well-advanced stage, and the establishment of the new\nDecarbon Technologies segment, including the restructuring of businesses.\nThe future strategic target model presented to the Supervisory Board, which\nis currently being elaborated in detail by the Executive Board, outlines a\ncoherent path for the further development of the group. It opens up the\nopportunity to win back the profitability of the business units and their\nrole as important industrial employers in the region.\n\nThe group is undergoing a challenging and urgently needed transformation\nprocess, in which reliability, leadership and clear priorities are of the\nessence. The extension of Miguel López’s contract is an expression of our\nconfidence in his leadership and our conviction that clear orientation and\ncontinuity along the chosen path are crucial to the further progress and\nfuture of thyssenkrupp.”\n\nLink (\n)\nto press release",

        "body": "post-summer - Analysis\n\nUS buyers are accelerating their pursuit of UK-listed corporates with 2Q25\nalready among the strongest quarters for transatlantic M&A since 2020,\naccording to Mergermarket data.\n\nThis momentum is expected to continue amid ongoing geopolitical tensions,\nlingering trade tariffs, and appealing UK valuations, with US buyers\nshowing increasing interest in takeovers of London-listed businesses,\ndealmakers said.\n\nIn 2Q25 so far, three deals worth an equity value of GBP 4.7bn have been\nagreed.\n\nThis makes it one of the strongest quarters for US acquisitions of\nLondon-listed corporates since the Coronavirus pandemic, exceeded only by\n1Q24 (GBP 14.6bn), 3Q21 (GBP 13.9bn) and 4Q20 (GBP 7.1bn).\n\nThe total number of UK-listed corporates which have announced deals to be\nacquired by US buyers in 1H25 is six, at a combined equity value of GBP\n6.4bn. This compares to five deals in 1H24 worth GBP 15.4bn, though this\nincludes International Paper's GBP 12.6bn acquisition of DS Smith, which\nmakes up 82% of that period's total deal value.\n\n“Compared to this time last year, I’m encouraged by where we stand,” said\nAdrian Beidas, Barclays co-head of UK Investment Banking. “Contrary to\nexpectations, market activity has rebounded swiftly, with clients\nre-engaging far more quickly than we had forecast.”\n\nAnd that interest looks set to continue. “I [was] really encouraged by the\nbounce back in May in terms of M&A dialogue,” said Citi UK Head of\nInvestment Banking, James Fleming. “That won’t translate into public\nannouncements perhaps until after the summer because M&A is a very long\ntail business.”\n\n(\n )\n\nRebalancing between strategic and private equity buyers\n\nA growing number of UK-listed companies are attracting interest from both\nUS strategic buyers and US-based private equity sponsors.\n\nSan Francisco-based DoorDash’s GBP 2.8bn cash offer for food delivery group\nDeliveroo represents the largest deal announced so far in 2Q. Also\nannounced in 2Q were US semiconductor group Qualcomm’s GBP 1.8bn offer for\nAlphawave, and US pawnbroker FirstCash’s GBP 351m offer for H&T Group.\n\nNot included in the figures for 2Q is a potential offer for Alpha Group by\nNew York-listed Corpay, where no price has been disclosed. Corpay’s initial\napproach was rejected, and it now has until 7 July to announce a firm offer\nfor Alpha Group, which has a current market capitalisation of GBP 1.3bn.\n\n“This year, we are seeing a rebalancing towards an even split between US\nstrategic buyers and financial buyers bidding for UK assets,” said Sonica\nTolani, Public M&A Partner at White & Case, who noted that last year’s\nactivity was mainly driven by private equity.\n\n“US strategics will act when it makes sense,” added Kate Cooper, M&A\nPartner at Freshfields. “They’ve benefited from a strong dollar, solid\neconomic performance, and significant firepower.”\n\nWhile not classified as cross-border transactions by Mergermarket data, US\nfinancial sponsors have continued to remain active in public-to-private\ndeals on the London market.\n\nRecent examples include Advent and KKR’s separate approaches for UK\ninstrumentation and control specialist Spectris. KKR’s proposal has been\nrejected by Spectris, while its board said it was minded to recommend\nAdvent’s GBP 3.7bn equity value offer.\n\nAdvent has until 7 July to firm up its offer, while KKR has until 11 July\nto make an offer under UK Put Up or Shut Up (PUSU) rules.\n\nKKR is also vying for UK healthcare REIT Assura.\n\nTogether with Stonepeak, KKR has bid GBP 1.7bn for Assura but is facing a\ncompeting bid from Assura’s UK-listed rival Primary Health Properties.\n\n“Looking mostly at activity post-summer, I’m seeing an increase in\npublic-to-privates,” said Fleming.\n\n“The financial sponsor community have got a lot of capital to commit and\nwe’re being asked to look at a lot of P2Ps.”\n\nHe added that US private equity firms are specifically looking at companies\nthat have a proportion, or a high proportion, of their earnings from the US\nand where they think that the asset could relist in the US in a number of\nyears’ time.\n\nValuation gaps, sector hotspots\n\nBeyond macroeconomic drivers, valuation gaps between UK and US companies\nare continuing to attract inbound interest.\n\nAlthough the dollar has depreciated against sterling in recent months, it\nis still trading at relatively historically high levels, said Patrick\nSarch, Head of UK Public M&A at White & Case.\n\nAnd, while UK equities have performed well recently – in particular the\nFTSE 250, where much of the deal activity is – UK corporates continue to\ntrade at much lower multiples than US equivalents, he explained.\n\n“This combination continues to make US inbound acquisitions into the UK\nattractive,” Sarch said.\n\n(\n )\n\nCooper pointed out that interest isn’t limited to the main market.\n\n“There’s also a lot of interest in AIM companies, which have struggled for\nmany years to attract strong valuations, and investors there are looking\nfor exits,\" she said.\n\nDealmakers report strong interest from US buyers across several sectors,\nparticularly technology, real estate, industrials and financial services.\n\nSarch said he continues to see “a high level of interest from US buyers for\ntechnology businesses” and expects this trend to carry on through the rest\nof the year.\n\nReal estate is another standout sector. The competitive bid battle for UK\nhealthcare landlord Assura demonstrates the appeal of the sector.\n\nUsman Khan, Private Capital Real Assets Partner at McDermott, Will & Emery,\nsaid a \"confluence of factors” is driving US interest in UK-listed real\nestate, including valuations that remain materially discounted to Net Asset\nValue (NAV) and the foreign-exchange dynamic.\n\n“For platforms with long-income characteristics, like healthcare, logistics\nor specialist infrastructure, the yield profile is especially appealing in\na rate environment that’s now starting to ease. The UK public real estate\nsector also offers transparent governance and liquidity not always\navailable elsewhere,” he said.\n\nFleming said industrials and financial services are “likely to be the bulk\nof the focus,” but emphasised that activity is “quite broad” across various\nsectors.\n\nby Elisha Juttla, with analytics by William Cain",

CVC,\nwhich had considered teaming up with ICG, has also dropped from the\nprocess, two further sources said. Ardian had looked at teaming up with\nanother sponsor, but didn’t submit a bid either, one source said.\n\nThose three parties, alongside KKR and Hillhouse, were among the sponsors\nthat had reportedly (\n)\nindicated early interest in the business.\n\nICG may still be active in the process, two sources said. ICG may seek to\nbe involved as a co-investor, as previously reported (\n)\nby the news service.\n\nHong Kong-based FountainVest is also still in the process, driven perhaps\nby its interest in Clarion’s exposure to China, two sources noted.\n\nThe sellside, which is advised by Goldman Sachs, expected non-binding bids\nto be submitted early this week, two sources said. However, bids were still\nbeing received mid-week, one of them added.\n\nSome participants have been reaching out to the sellside this week but have\nyet to receive a process update, two sources said.\n\nAccording to two of the sources, some potential suitors were valuing the\nbusiness at an enterprise value of around GBP 1.6bn-GBP 1.75bn – well below\nthe GBP 2bn that the sellside was reportedly targeting. Some bids may still\nhave been submitted around the GBP 2bn mark, though, a separate source\nnoted.\n\nClarion has been marketed off a 2025 EBITDA in the region of GBP 170m, one\nsource said.\n\nThe events organiser generated around GBP 430m in revenue in the fiscal\nyear ending 31 January 2024, according (\n)\nto its most recent Companies House filing. This compared to around GBP 257m\nin the previous 12 months.\n\nAsia made up around 36% of the group’s revenue in the year to January 2024,\nfollowed by the US with 35%. The remaining 28% was generated out of Europe,\nthe filing shows. A year earlier, the Asia portion was just 23% while the\nUS accounted for 44% of the top line.\n\nSome potential bidders voiced concerns over Clarion’s exposure to China, as\nwell as broader geopolitical trends such as economic de-globalisation and\nrising conflict, which they believe may dampen demand for international\nbusiness travel, one source said.\n\nBlackstone, PAI, CVC and ICG declined to comment. Goldman Sachs, Clarion\nand FountainVest did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nby Edin Imsirovic, Min Ho, Lucinda Guthrie and Charlie Taylor-Kroll",

        "body": "food distributor nears end\n\nNPM Capital is in exclusivity to acquire Elbfrost, a German frozen food\ndistributor and wholesaler, from current owner Bencis Capital, two sources\nfamiliar with the situation said.\n\nThe Netherlands-based sponsor has edged past a handful of other private\nequity firms, including FSN and Alvarez & Marsal Capital (A&M), becoming\nthe frontrunner for the asset in a competitive auction, the first source\nand a third source familiar said.\n\nEarlier this month, this news service reported (\n)\nthat NPM was among a handful of late-stage bidders, including FSN and IK\nPartners, circling the firm ahead of confirmatory offers. Sellside advisor\nHarris Williams is marketing the business off EUR 17m–EUR 19m in EBITDA for\n2024, as reported.\n\nNPM is in discussions with private credit firms to procure unitranche\nfinancing for its acquisition of Elbfrost, the first two sources said. The\nsponsor is looking to line up two or three debt funds for buyout financing,\nthe first source added.\n\nLenders are offering to lever the firm at around or slightly above 5x\nEBITDA, although some private credit providers are pitching debt packages\nin the 4.5x–4.75x range, the first source said. This implies a debt package\nof up to EUR 85m–EUR 95m based off the marketed EBITDA.\n\nPricing for the unitranche could land at around 500bps over the reference\nrate, the first source added.\n\nThis news service previously wrote (\n)\nthat financiers were in heated competition to provide buyout financing,\nwith pitches from the most aggressive debt funds stretching into 5x\nterritory. Other funds were pitching leverage of around 4.25x–4.75x EBITDA,\nwhile bank pitches were roughly one turn lower at 3.5x–4x.\n\nWhile not the most interesting company with its focus on frozen food,\nfinanciers generally see Elbfrost as a great lending case due to its size,\nstability and reliable cashflows, the first source said.\n\nThe firm also posts decent margins of around 13% and has a sticky customer\nbase of institutions like hospitals and cafeterias, as reported (\n)\n. Some financiers declined the credit, however, as the business is somewhat\ncommoditised with its lack of branded products and a clear-cut USP (unique\nselling proposition), the third source said.\n\nBencis has been invested in Elbfrost since 2022, according to its website.\nElbfrost is a food wholesaler and logistics provider specialising in frozen\nproducts for commercial kitchens, including caterers, business canteens,\nhospitals, care centres and educational institutions. It operates across\nthree sites in Germany and has a product portfolio including vegetables,\nchicken, fish and convenience food.\n\nFSN declined to comment. NPM Capital, A&M, Harris Williams, Bencis Capital\nand Elbfrost did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nby Patrick Costello",

        "body": "takeover interest – Europe Morning Flash - Analysis\n\nBreak-up and takeover possibilities around London-listed telco BT Group\nappear to be gaining traction.\n\nAllison Kirkby, CEO of the business, indicated BT may consider a spin-off\nof broadband unit Openreach once it completes the roll-out of its full\nfibre network, potentially as early as next year, according to a Financial\nTimes report last weekend (15 June).\n\nWhile BT is not actively pursuing a spin-off of the unit, it could explore\nthe option if Openreach’s value is not appropriately reflected in BT’s\nshare price, Kirkby said.\n\n(\n )\n\nThe Morning Flash has been tracking takeover and break-up possibilities\naround BT for several years, most recently in September last year (\n)\n, because of a sum-of-the parts discount centred upon Openreach.\n\nEstimates for Openreach’s value have varied widely in media reports over\nthe past couple of years but most have pointed to a valuation higher than\nBT’s current market cap of GBP 19bn.\n\nThat valuation opportunity has attracted the attention of a variety of\nstrategic investors.\n\nBharti Enterprises, an industrial conglomerate backed by India’s Mittal\nfamily, acquired a 24.5% stake in BT last year from French telecoms mogul\nPatrick Drahi.\n\nDeutsche Telekom owns a 12% stake, a shareholding it received in\npart-consideration for the mobile network EE, which BT acquired for GBP\n12.5bn during 2015.\n\nAnd Mexican telco entrepreneur Carlos Slim upped his stake to 4%, from\n3.2%, late last year.\n\nAll three investors are likely to be watching developments closely.\n\nA prospective spin of Openreach is likely to provide a major valuation\ncatalyst for BT and could flush out bid interest as a result.\n\nShares in BT closed at 191 pence yesterday (19 June), up 4% since the\nreport on Sunday.\n\nStora Enso considers partial spin-off of forestry assets\n\nHelsinki-based paper and packaging producer Stora Enso is considering a\npartial spin-off of its Swedish forestry assets, CEO Hans Sohlström said\nearlier this week via a stock exchange announcement (\n)\n(18 June).\n\nStora Enso has kicked off a strategic review of the forestry assets, which\ncover approximately 1.2m hectares of forest land and had a fair value of\nEUR 5.8bn as of 31 March 2025.\n\nThe review is being conducted to increase shareholder value by unlocking\nthe full potential of both its forestry and industrial packaging assets.\n\nA break-up might also put Stora Enso in the takeover spotlight in an\nactively consolidating packaging sector.\n\nStora Enso plans to provide an update on the strategic review by the end of\n2025.\n\nIts R shares gained about 15% over the last couple of days following the\nannouncement and closed at EUR 9.70 for a total market cap of EUR 7.7bn.\n\nMetro Bank shares spike after reported Pollen Street interest\n\nCould London-listed Metro Bank become the next takeover target in an\nongoing consolidation of banks across the UK and Europe?\n\nShares in the lender spiked as much as 18% on Monday (16 June) to 133 pence\nfollowing a Sky News report that it had received a takeover approach from\nfinancial sponsor Pollen Street Capital.\n\nMetro Bank’s stock price pared some of those gains later in the week to\nclose yesterday at 126 pence for a market cap of GBP 847m, up 12% on the\nweek through Thursday’s close.\n\nby Saritha Dantu\n\nThis report should not be relied upon to make investment decisions.\nFurthermore, this report is not intended and should not be construed as\ninvestment advice.
