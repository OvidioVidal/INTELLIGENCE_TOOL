DETAILED PRESS RELEASES

🚗 AUTOMOTIVE

1. Daimler Truck, Volvo launch software JV Coretura

Key Points:
• Focus on software development for commercial vehicles
• 50% held by each parent
• Volume of investments depends on milestones, technical progress

Details:
Daimler Truck, a German vehicle maker, and Swedish auto group Volvo have announced the launch of a software joint venture named Coretura.

Volvo Group and Daimler Truck, two of the leaders in the commercial vehicle industry, announce the launch of Coretura AB, their joint venture aimed at transforming the commercial vehicle industry through a new software-defined vehicle platform and establishing a new industry standard. Coretura will enable Volvo Group and Daimler Truck and other future customers to provide differentiating stand-alone digital vehicle applications for their products.

Following the binding joint venture agreements signed on October 28, 2024, Volvo Group and Daimler Truck have obtained all required regulatory approvals and have now launched the new company Coretura. Following the joint venture transaction, Coretura, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, began operations in the beginning of June 2025.

Karin Rådström, President and CEO of Daimler Truck: “With Coretura, we are setting a clear strategic focus on software development for commercial vehicles. This is a big and really exciting step — not just for us, but for the entire industry and our customers. Together we are starting the digital-driven future of trucks and buses, ultimately making commercial vehicles smarter, more connected, and more efficient than ever before.”

Martin Lundstedt, President and CEO of the Volvo Group, adds:  "Coretura represents a bold step forward in the evolution of commercial vehicles. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and collaborative innovation, we're setting the stage for a new era of connectivity and efficiency in the industry. This venture underscores our commitment to not only advancing our products but also paving the way for sustainable and intelligent transportation solutions."

Coretura will be led by a four-member Executive Management team consisting of two members from each of the shareholders. Johan Lundén has been appointed as CEO coming from Volvo Group where he previously held responsibility for Strategic Product Planning, Project and Innovation management.

Unlocking the digital future of commercial vehicles

As commercial vehicles are becoming more digital, the mission of Coretura is to build the non-differentiating core, a standardized and open software-defined vehicle platform and dedicated commercial vehicle operating system.

Coretura’s activities also include the specification and procurement of centralized high-performance control units dedicated for commercial vehicles and capable of handling large amounts of data. This will decouple software and hardware development cycles, allowing end customers to purchase and update digital applications wirelessly ‘over the air,’ enhancing safety, efficiency and customer experience.

“This joint venture blends the agility of a start-up with the stability and expertise of our major shareholders. We are proud and energized to lead the digital transformation in the commercial vehicle industry—backed by strong shareholder support and committed to shaping the industry’s future.” says Johan Lundén, CEO of Coretura.

Starting with around 50 employees, Coretura is set to grow stepwise. This allows the shareholders to pool resources and invest in accordance with technical progress and achievement of milestones. Coretura thereby follows a collaborative co-development approach with its customers, aiming to launch its first products in vehicles by the end of the decade.

Volvo Group and Daimler Truck will remain competitors and continue to differentiate their range of product and services offerings, including their respective digital solutions.

Coretura is open to cooperation and invites new and traditional suppliers and partners who share its values to join in creating the future of the industry.

An article by German daily Boersen-Zeitung said the joint venture will be 50% held by each parent.

The report noted that the companies did not specify the volume of planned investments, citing a Daimler Truck spokesperson as saying they depend on the achievements of milestones and technical progress.

4. Aya Healthcare acquires Locum's Nest

Key Points:
• Combination enhances value for clients
• Locum's Nest streamlines NHS hospital shift filling
• Aya operates world’s largest digital staffing platform for healthcare labor services

Details:
Press release

Aya Healthcare, the largest healthcare talent software and staffing company in the United States, today announced the acquisition of Locum’s Nest, a leading workforce solutions provider in the United Kingdom (U.K.) that connects healthcare professionals with open shifts at National Health Service (NHS) hospitals through a powerful mobile app. This combination unites two leading providers in their respective countries to share best practices and innovations, enhancing value for clients.

Locum’s Nest was founded by physicians Dr. Nicholas Andreou and Dr. Ahmed Shahrabani, to streamline how NHS hospitals fill open shifts with qualified physicians, advanced practice and other healthcare professionals. Its cloud-based platform was the first to establish a managed float pool spanning multiple hospitals and regions.

“We are excited to welcome Locum’s Nest to the Aya family of brands and are energized by the opportunity to transform healthcare staffing around the world through innovation, technology and purpose,” said Emily Hazen, CEO of Aya Healthcare.

Locum’s Nest has built a reputation as a trusted technology partner to the NHS by relentlessly focusing on the needs of its healthcare customers. Since its founding in 2016, the company has helped pioneer the use of technology to enhance the welfare and working experience of the NHS contingent workforce. At the heart of this innovation is its digitally-powered float pools which enable NHS Trusts to work together seamlessly across regions, share workforce capacity, and support staff with flexible, well-matched shifts. This approach not only drives efficiency and cost savings but also fosters a more sustainable and compassionate workforce model across the NHS.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Aya in advancing our collective mission to improve healthcare worldwide,” said Dr. Nicholas Andreou, co-founder of Locum’s Nest. “Aya’s resources and expertise will help us grow faster, innovate more boldly, and ultimately make a greater difference.”

Locum’s Nest will continue operating under its own brand, with a steadfast commitment to supporting the NHS and the healthcare professionals who power it. “As part of the Aya family, we have the scale and infrastructure to take that mission nationwide - immediately, whilst investing in the principles and partnerships that have defined us from day one,” said Dr Ahmed Shahrabani, co-founder of Locum’s Nest.

Aya Healthcare is the largest healthcare talent software and staffing company in the United States. Aya operates the world’s largest digital staffing platform delivering every component of healthcare-focused labor services, including travel nursing and allied health, per diem, permanent staff hiring, interim leadership, locum tenens and non-clinical professionals. Aya’s AI-enabled software solutions, which include vendor management, float pool technology, provider solutions and predictive analytics, combined with its digital talent marketplaces, provide hospital systems greater efficiencies, superior operating results and reduced labor costs. While technology drives efficiency and scale, Aya’s 6,000+ global employees power the company to deliver unparalleled accountability and exceptional experiences for clients and clinicians. Aya’s company culture is rooted in giving back and supports organizations around food security, education, healthcare, safe shelter and equity.

6. BioMar IPO advisers picked, Eutelsat mulls EUR 1.35bn rights issue – EMEA ECM Digest

Details:
Key Ongoing Deals

- Germany's Autodoc is conducting IPO bookbuild between EUR 58 to EUR 61 per share. The period starts on 17 June and ends 24 June. Barclays Bank, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and Jefferies are the global coordinators.

- Sweden's Hacksaw AB is conducting IPO bookbuild at SEK 77 per share. The period starts on 17 June and ends 24 June. Citigroup, Carnegie and Jefferies are the global coordinators.

Initial Public Offering (IPO) and Spin-Offs

Germany

Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs is reviewing exit options for Securing Energy for Europe (SEFE), Bloomberg reported. The exit options include a sale, breakup, or merger with fellow nationalised utility Uniper SE, with a plan due by mid-2025. SEFE is working with Boston Consulting Group on the analysis. A merger with Uniper — also nationalised in 2022 — is seen as a fallback if Uniper’s sale to suitors like Equinor, EPH (Daniel Křetínský), or Brookfield fails. Uniper’s complex asset mix and limited renewables make both a sale and IPO challenging. - Press report

Denmark

Schouw & Co. has hired banks for a potential IPO of BioMar Group, Bloomberg reported. DNB Carnegie Holding AB, Morgan Stanley, Danske Bank AS and Nordea Bank Abp have been appointed by the Danish company for the listing. The IPO could value BioMar, the Denmark-based industrial fish feed company, at roughly USD 2bn. - Press report

Russia

Property developer GloraX and household services platform Airo plan to launch IPOs, Vedomosti reported. - Press report

8. Berkeley appoints Richard Stearn as CEO

Key Points:
• Incumbent CEO Rob Perrins to be appointed as Executive Chair
• Net profit for FY25 drops to GBP 382m from GBP 397m a year ago

Details:
Having overseen the foundations of the next phase of the Company's strategy, Michael Dobson, Berkeley's Chairman, will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the Company's Annual General Meeting ("AGM") on 5 September 2025.

The Board would like to thank Mike for his outstanding leadership over the last three years which has seen a number of important developments for Berkeley during a period of heightened geo-political and macro-economic volatility. These include the strategic review that resulted in the development of the Company's 10-year strategy, Berkeley 2035; the identification and appointment of high calibre new Board members; the independent investor perception study that has helped shape the proposals contained in today's announcement; and further changes to benefit the effective operation of the Board.

At this time, the Board is very conscious of the complexity of today's operating environment in our industry, the role of housing in the Government's growth agenda and the importance of the current executive team to maintaining Berkeley's unique business model and culture to drive long-term value for shareholders, while also recognising the need to formulate and execute a successful succession strategy.

Reflecting this, and after careful consideration, it is proposed that Rob Perrins should be appointed as Executive Chair to succeed Mike as Berkeley embarks upon its new 10-year strategy.

Rob has been Berkeley's CEO since 2009 and has overseen a period of exceptionally strong performance and value creation. He has deep industry knowledge to lead through a period of complex regulatory change; respected working relationships with today's political leaders; and an inherent understanding of the Company's business model, culture and values, to foster the commitment of the senior leadership team through this period of transition.

Appointing Rob as Executive Chair will provide assurance to key stakeholders, including our people and the leaders in National and Local Government, of the continuity in leadership needed at this time. It resolves succession in a way that retains the Berkeley culture and values, the importance of which is recognised by shareholders and other stakeholders alike. While giving clarity to all over the future of the senior leadership team, it also paves the way for emerging talent.

As required by the UK Governance Code, Rachel Downey, the Senior Independent Director will consult with major shareholders in relation to this proposal.

On Rob becoming Executive Chair, Richard Stearn will become CEO. Richard has been Berkeley's CFO since 2015 and therefore has a strong understanding of the industry and Berkeley's business model. His appointment will uphold Berkeley's longstanding tradition and preference for promoting from within which maintains the culture and values of the organisation and provides continuity and stability for the Company, our people and shareholders. It is intended that these appointments would become effective from the conclusion of the AGM.

Once the consultation process has been completed, any further Board changes will be announced, including the appointment of a new CFO, a role for which there are strong internal candidates who have been with Berkeley for a number of years.

Other Non-Executive changes

William Jackson has announced his intention not to seek re-election at the September AGM.  The Board would like to thank William for his strategic insight and extensive contribution during his tenure.

The Company is delighted to announce the appointment of Richard Dakin to its Board as a Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of the AGM.  Richard has had a long and distinguished career in banking, capital markets and real estate through both his executive roles, most recently as Head of CBRE's European investment banking and debt and structured finance business and, prior to that, as Managing Director and Head of the Real Estate business support unit at Lloyds Bank, and as a non-executive director at Derwent London plc.

The Company is well advanced with the appointment of a further high calibre, non-executive director with extensive industry and public company experience, anticipated to be announced early in the New Year.

Rob Perrins, Chief Executive, said: "On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mike for his significant contribution to Berkeley over the last three years and in particular his leadership in the development of the Berkeley 2035 strategy. The Board is stronger for his period of leadership. I would also like to thank William for his contribution to the Board and advice over his tenure.  We wish them both the very best in the future. I am delighted to welcome Richard Dakin to the Board.  Richard brings with him many years of directly relevant experience and will be a fantastic addition."

Michael Dobson, Chairman, said: "Berkeley is a Company with a proud and distinct heritage and a great deal of potential. It is an honour to have played a role. Rob has been a great Chief Executive for 16 years and I wish him and the Company all the best for the future."

9. Moyca attracts interest from industrial, financial groups - report (translated)

Key Points:
• No formal bids for Moyca, despite interest from multiple parties
• Moyca's 2024 revenues EUR 190m, EBITDA EUR 29m, potential sale at 6-7 times EBITDA
• Deutsche Bank exploring sale of Moyca, acquired by ProA Capital in 2016

Details:
Moyca, a Spanish agricultural company owned by private equity firm ProA Capital, has attracted interest from both industrial and financial groups, according to a report by El Economista, which cited unnamed sources.

Sources consulted by the publication indicated that Moyca—specialized in the production of seedless grapes—has been approached by U.S. investors, the Peruvian conglomerate Gloria, and Citri & Co., another agricultural group backed by private equity firm Miura Capital.

As of now, no formal offers have been made, the report noted.

Moyca closed 2024 with revenues of EUR 190m and an EBITDA of approximately EUR 29m, according to other sources cited by El Economista. While the company’s market valuation remains to be seen, expectations suggest the deal could be signed at a multiple of six to seven times EBITDA.

ProA Capital mandated Deutsche Bank last year to explore a sale, according to the report.

Moyca was acquired by ProA Capital in late 2016 in a deal valued between EUR 170m and EUR 200m.

11. Carr's returns GBP 70m to shareholders via share buyback

Key Points:
• Number of shares to be repurchased is 42.9m, 45.4% of share capital
• Tender offer oversubscribed as 55.4m shares tendered at 163p apiece
• Carr's advised by Investec, market cap c. GBP 134m

Details:
Carr's Group, the British FMCG and auto services company with a market cap of GBP 134m, announced the results of its tender offer.

On 22 April 2025, Carr's Group sold its engineering division to Cadre Holdings for an enterprise value of GBP 75m and expressed its intention to return up to GBP 70m to its shareholders by repurchasing its shares.

Results of Tender Offer and Total Voting Rights

Following the close of the Tender Offer at 1.00 p.m. (UK time) on 19 June 2025, the Company is pleased to announce the results of the Tender Offer, details of which were set out in the Circular published by the Company on 21 May 2025.

Tender Offer

The maximum aggregate number of Ordinary Shares that could be purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer was 42,944,785 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 45.4 per cent. of the Company's issued share capital as at the Tender Offer Record Date, at a Tender Price of 163 pence per Ordinary Share.

Under the Tender Offer, valid applications to tender shares were received in respect of 55,419,051 Ordinary Shares, equal to approximately 58.6 per cent. of the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue as at the Tender Offer Record Date. Accordingly, all valid tenders of Shareholders' Individual Basic Entitlements have been accepted and will be purchased in full. Additionally, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer as set out in the Circular, all excess tenders have been scaled back pro rata to the total number of such Ordinary Shares tendered, such that the total cost of Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer does not exceed £70 million. As such, a total of 42,944,785 Ordinary Shares will be purchased under the Tender Offer and subsequently cancelled on 23 June 2025.

The total value to be returned to Shareholders pursuant to the Tender Offer will therefore be approximately £70 million. Payment of the consideration due to Shareholders whose tender applications under the Tender Offer have been accepted will be despatched (by cheque or by a CREST payment, as appropriate) on or before 30 June 2025. It is also anticipated that balancing share certificates in respect of unsold certificated Ordinary Shares will be despatched by no later than 30 June 2025.

Total Voting Rights

Following the implementation of the Tender Offer and the cancellation of the 42,944,785 successfully tendered Ordinary Shares due to take place on 23 June 2025, the total number of voting shares in Carr's in issue will be 51,638,052.

This figure may be used by Shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.

Capitalised terms used in this announcement (unless otherwise defined) have the meanings set out in the announcement of the Company dated 21 May 2025 in respect of the Tender Offer.

12. Eurmoda poised to close two acquisitions this year, double turnover – sponsor

Key Points:
• Expects turnover to reach EUR 90m post acquisitions
• Aurora maintains ‘rich’ pipeline of potential targets

Details:
Italian manufacturer Eurmoda is set to double its turnover with two strategic acquisitions expected to close this year, Piero Migliorini, partner at its sponsor Aurora Growth Capital, told Mergermarket.

The company, which produces metal accessories for the luxury industry, has a "very ambitious" growth plan and a "very rich" acquisition pipeline, Migliorini said, and will “proceed step by step, to choose the right moves to compete, also through strategic M&A opportunities.”

Eurmoda expects its turnover to reach around EUR 90m once it closes the two deals, Migliorini said. The company is already in exclusive talks about the first acquisition, a specialist steel-accessories producer, he said, adding that this deal has just entered due diligence.

The undisclosed target is a “very high-performing company from a financial point of view”, he said. Last year, it generated around EUR 20m in revenue with a 20% EBITDA margin, demonstrating double-digit growth, he said.

The target is a strong strategic fit for Eurmoda; it operates in a highly specific sector and supplies a primary luxury company that is not currently a Eurmoda client, giving it "exceptional" appeal, he said. The deal is expected to close as soon as this year, he added.

The second acquisition, for which negotiations are "very advanced", is a Spanish company operating in metal processing for the bijoux sector, Migliorini said. This target, which generates around EUR 10m revenue, would allow Eurmoda to diversify its client base by connecting with a new type of customer, and to have a presence in the jewellery sector, he said.

Eurmoda will fund such acquisitions using a combination of its own resources and contributions from the new partners supporting its growth, he said.

At the beginning of June, Aurora Growth Capital signed a binding agreement to acquire ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1v4zoM_DXWzQFF6iM-6JA0L319QPMu6SG5yRLdqHVsr6wUbX_9Iuli0T3shQAJDmcGQx8uOc1PM-eH6PR6rVGtsF6uV5taKYC6uds0tcS11LiUFpZG-GnqU_AljYMbxpK6X80sQk6Fc_L_-vnkSAWwbZDRdmSXOloDnbbegMJWtbIR4dKXS-a7MbLjob5fi-giUGtETPPkSzhx3PjCDgF1DaZG2oOpaKXVrSxI0VGwk1aDMdI0SvDw5vr0xuLkqItBNk3LLXS2sWA70tFb6khCIOVFut0FgwRGK60WqkHQ1C09Na2VRJWCM-dnzmefX7kswngWad7zXFzn-5lF706lTHNFqwq3FW7_2E7j4Afff5QU5iu0wm0Yh8JDqXArARRqbRWI89XoQ3T_7x_wuH_Sx_2j3uGBji__0PHloB7vd_0Bn-Tu5fVz9_lfOuxfK9p8wfYfE7uYnnkuYspjvITivou4DrvU8zXZpkUftfaxAQMAEk0gQBQ_Lpw_boEZCMQRmQF1s5SoyYSgWvKqCdDKTmTnh5h5XmROz_UcTucUS6XgxNm_Tz6XgfPNqyjuN3NFm79yFz5PvS9Xfd9l14Xfi7h8vSQCSEOWtHhz-DMAAP__yB3WKA ) approximately 50% of Eurmoda. Following the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of July, existing shareholder Mindful Capital Partners will hold a 27% stake in the business, along with founder and CEO Marco Vecellio and Auro Macuz, while other minority investors will completely exit.

The two ongoing acquisitions alone are projected to boost Eurmoda's financial standing, Migliorini said. The company could grow this year from its current EUR 60m in revenues with EUR 10m EBITDA to around EUR 90m in turnover and EUR 17m in EBITDA, he said.

“This is a tremendous growth for a sector that is generally suffering,” he said, adding, however, that as a strategic supplier to the high-end segment of the luxury market, Eurmoda has not experienced difficulties.

Beyond the immediate targets, Aurora Growth Capital maintains a rich pipeline of companies that can complement Eurmoda's accessory offerings, he said.

The company projects strong organic growth next year, building on 2025, which is expected to close in line with 2024, Migliorini said, adding that Eurmoda expects 2026 revenue “in the order of EUR 110m-EUR 120m”.

Eurmoda specialises in manufacturing metal accessories, primarily for leather goods such as handbags and belts, which account for around 90% of its revenue, as reported ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1v4zoM_DXWzQFFfdg66JA0L319QPMu7iG5yRLdqHVsr6QUbX_9Iuli0T3shQAJDmcGQ-cvKeanTOkhWLXZKJRrrNvNeltLCVCbu62pOW64wpY30GrmlmWM3pU4T3aaSxx-NZn5FAul6P51-WSF9ND0nodmEE2rQqNhUI3TILGXPTfMX8ZySXQ3B7I01fcbFmwA0WsWYl5c8ScKW1fIIqCqQdcoOtCVWCt5KyshxZGR5Y0Crbk2ktH0Zsf4RuxkjUY1DKpplFHeaw8-kA6tIyOa1jhg8XYXNArQSiq5kgZBiaF1wvQNF6KScKb0TOns0iuVlZ_PLOaOcrGDGzOx0Z5KWXIl1hXuKtz9sR3nyU1u_CjR5yu0wp2fp0JTqXDHASSqlnNk56vRh2D_7x7w2D2pY_eo9ngQx5d_xPHlIB_v9-MBn_j-5fVz__lfPHSvldh-wbqPhWyIz5QLW9IcLr7Y7yKuwyGOdE3W9OiCUi4Y0ADAUXsBiOzHhdLHLTANXlBAIkBlWo5KaO9lL5w0Hno-sGTdFBLlVaL4XGd_OsdQKgknSu59calMlG5eWbG_mSux_St3ofMyunLV9112Xei9sMvXSyIA16IRir1Z_BkAAP__nLbWEg ) by this news service. Its past acquisitions include Italian peers Alce, ABC Morini and Macuz, as reported.

Based in Pederobba, near Treviso, Eurmoda has around 360 employees, and production plants in Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany.

13. ISS urges JD Sports shareholders to reject remuneration policy; Meyer Burger postpones EGM – Europe Corporate Radar

JD Sports shareholders have been urged by proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) to vote against the FTSE-100 sportswear retailer’s proposed remuneration policy, The Times reported ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1z2jAU_DXWzczT04ftgw4QSprOhF7IAW6y9AwKtnElAUl-fQfSdnLpZWe0M6vd1cq6cwzpJVF88kYtFgrlHMt6MV-WUgKUzcOyKTkuuMKaV1BrZqepD87mcBrNeMqh-3NIzMWQKQb73aaDEdJB1Truq05UtfKVhk5VVoPEVra8Ye7c53Okh5MnQ2P5uGDeeBCtZj6kyWZ3IL-0mQwCqhJ0iWIDuhBzJe8wE1LsGBleKdCa60YyGi-mDxdiB1NVQJrXXteusZXokFpZV60n6OrWNQ0L93tBowCtpJIz2SAo0dVWNG3FhSgkDBT3FAcbj5Rn7jSwkDaUsulsn4j15pDzlAoxL3BV4Op6vc6sy-ESUh5OY8ineBMVuLI3CGOmvg97Gh0VuLoEuv5l3ZDKN3_ME7LhVvzJm5-bJ9xtXtRu86zWuBW7129i97qVz4_rfosvfP16_Fh__AjbzbEQy0_Z5n0i48OeUmZTPPmzy-ZrhRvZhZ5uSzctWq-U9Q1oAOConQBE9utM8f0-oAYnyCMRoGpqjkpo52QrrGwctLxj0djRR0qzSGFfJncYgs-FhANF-zbZmEeK6f5s2fxzLsTyv96Zhqm3-Zbva-wy01tm588vigBci0oodjH4OwAA__8r0d2r ) . According to the report, ISS argues that JD Sports’ proposal, which would offer restricted shares worth up to 50% of salary and performance shares worth up to 250%, does not justify support given a decline in JD Sports' profits and share price, and the market uncertainty.

15. Enni CEO eyes further acquisitions in water, energy sectors (translated)

Key Points:
• CEO expects strong performance, seeks stake acquisitions and partnerships
• Energy distribution turnaround reached, with potential in Lower Rhine region
• Enni's FY24 profit jumps to EUR 43.7m, despite 20% revenue drop

Details:
Enni, a German utility group, eyes further growth via acquisitions in the water and energy sectors, Zeitung fuer kommunale Wirtschaft reported, citing CEO Stefan Kraemer.

Kraemer told the German-language trade publication that he expects the group to continue performing well in the future. He sees further growth opportunities through stake acquisitions and partnerships, for example in the water sectors. Kraemer also believes that the turnaround in the energy distribution segment has been reached.

Last but not least, Kraemer sees great potential in the Lower Rhine region in areas related to energy, mobility, and heating transition, the report said.

The piece pointed out that a one-off special effect resulted in a jump in Enni's FY24 profit to EUR 43.7m (FY23: EUR 39.8m), while revenue fell by 20% to EUR 315m, mainly due to declining energy prices and sales losses.

17. Infra fund consortiums file TenneT Germany stake bids

Key Points:
• CPP Investments and Iberdola form consortium
• APG and Norges Bank Investment Management join together
• QIC, CIP, CDPQ and Allianz make separate bids

Details:
Several major infrastructure investors have submitted non-binding offers for a minority stake in the German division of Dutch transmission grid owner TenneT, according to sources.

A tie-up of CPP Investments and Iberdrola, advised by Barclays, filed an offer ahead of yesterday’s deadline ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1v2zAM_TXWzQFFfdg-6JA0S9cBzS7uIbnJEt2odWxPkoumv35IOgzdYRcCJPj43sOjdUsM6SlRfPBGbTYK5RrLerPellIClM3dtik5brjCmldQa2bneQjO5jCNZpxy6P80ibkYMsVgv9t0MkI6qDrHfdWLqla-0tCrymqQ2MmON8wtQ14i3U2eDI3l_YZ540F0mvmQZpvdifzWZjIIqErQJYoWdCHWSt7KSkhxZGR4pUBrrhvJaHwzQ3gjdjJN77ivq0pKX_fQU82hB3SglFS8Ac7C7S5oFKCVVHIlGwQl-tqKpqu4EIWEM8VnimcbXymv3HRmIbWUsuntkIgN5pTznAqxLnBX4O6f7TCNdrTDJQeXrtACd24aM425wB0HkKg5SCjEjp2vXh-8-dk-4LF9Usf2Ue3xII4v38Tx5SAf7_fDAZ_4_uX1Y__xIxza10JsP2HtZSbjwzOlzOY4-cVl81XHddiHga7hNh1ar5T1DWgA4KidAET2a6F4uWWmwQnySASompqjEto52QkrGwcd71k0dvSR0ipSeC6TO52Dz4WEE0X7PtuYR4o3uyybv8yF2P6XO9N5Hmy-6vsqu8z0ntny-ZUIwLWohGJvBn8HAAD__4MB1f4 ) , as did Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, advised by JPMorgan, the sources added.

A consortium comprising Dutch pension fund APG, advised by RBC, and Norges Bank Investment Management is also among the bidders. Their joint participation in the TenneT sale comes after the consortium withdrew from the sale of RWE’s stake in Amprion, another large German grid operator in the market, the sources explained.

Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), CDPQ and Allianz are also said by sources to have filed non-binding offers for TenneT, in a process that will require incoming investors to commit up to around EUR 4bn of investment.

The deal will involve the new investor acquiring new shares rather than those of the existing shareholders.

TenneT’s German arm generated EBITDA of about EUR 3bn in 2024, according to calculations by S&P.

Given the scale of the transaction, sources said that Lazard and ABN AMRO, the sellside advisors, are giving flexibility to the bidders to join forces at a later stage, if they decide to do so.

Sources added that while CIP filed an offer that entails it investing less than EUR 4bn, this flexibility means it could still advance in the process by joining a consortium.

After the collection of NBOs, the next crucial step in the process is the upcoming decision by the Dutch government, TenneT’s owner, on moving ahead with the sale or pursuing a partial initial public offering for the business instead.

This decision is expected to be formally announced in July, as laid down in May in the recent letter sent to the parliament by Dutch Finance Minister Eelco Heinen.

TenneT is one of Germany’s four transmission grid operators alongside 50Hertz Transmission, TransnetBW and Amprion.

Last month, the asset management subsidiary of German lender Commerzbank, Commerz Real, acquired an indirect share of around 4.5% in Amprion.

Other recent deals in the sector saw German utility EnBW selling a 24.95% stake in TransnetBW to a consortium led by local insurance group SV SparkassenVersicherung, for around EUR 1bn.

The buyer agreed to pay around EUR 1bn for the stake, an EnBW spokesperson confirmed to Infralogic.

Investing in transmission grid operators offers a significant growth opportunity, but also large capital requirements.

Amprion has vast investment plans totalling some EUR 35bn over the next four years, much of which is due to be funded by equity, to cover upgrades to accommodate increasing renewables penetration and growing electric vehicle use.

While such investment places large financial demands on investors, it also holds the prospect of strong returns underpinned by government support for the energy transition.

APG, Barclays, TenneT, JPMorgan, GIC, Norges and CPP declined to comment. Iberdrola, Allianz, CDPQ and CIP did not respond to requests for comment.

19. UK CMA consults on ChampionX/Schlumberger Phase 2 remedies

Key Points:
• Comments due by 4 July
• Proposed divestments to REDA Energy, LongRange Capital, Précis LLC license deal
• CMA deems proposed undertakings suitable to address competition concerns
• the divestment of SLB’s production chemicals technology business (PCT) business in the UK to a CMA-approved upfront buyer;
• the sale of CHX’s US Synthetic (USS) business to a CMA-approved buyer; and
• a global licence covering relevant intellectual property and know-how of CHX’s Quartzdyne business to a CMA-approved alternative developer of quartz sensors and transducers, together with agreements to provide SLB’s rival suppliers of permanent downhole gauges in the UK access to Quartzdyne’s quartz sensors and transducers for an interim period.

Details:
The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is consulting on proposed undertakings tied to a Phase II investigation into Schlumberger's (SLB) acquisition of ChampionX (CHX), according to a case page update today (20 June).

To address the substantial lessening of competition (SLC) identified by the CMA, the parties have the following remedies:

The agency currently considers that the proposed commitments and the purchase of the PCT divestment business by REDA Energy, the purchase of the USS divestment business by LongRange Capital and the Quartzdyne license agreement granted to Précis LLC are, in the circumstances of this case, appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the competition concerns identified in the SLC decision and form as comprehensive a solution to these concerns as is reasonable and practicable.

The CMA, therefore, is giving notice that it proposes to accept the proposed undertakings. The deadline to submit comments closes on 4 July.

Key Points:
• Bidder reaches agreement via subsidiary Polar Nimrod Topco
• Offer price of 102.60p per share, 23.62% premium from last closing price
• Dickson Minto advised bidder, Singer Capital Markets advised DORE

Details:
RECOMMENDED CASH ACQUISITION

of

DOWNING RENEWABLES & INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST PLC

by

POLAR NIMROD TOPCO LIMITED

(a newly formed vehicle, wholly-owned by Bagnall Energy Limited)

to be implemented by means of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act

Summary

·          The boards of directors of Bagnall Energy Limited ("Bagnall") and Downing Renewables & Infrastructure Trust plc ("DORE") are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition, pursuant to which Polar Nimrod Topco Limited ("Bidco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bagnall, will acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of DORE that the Bagnall Group does not already own (the "Acquisition").

·          It is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by means of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act (the "Scheme").

·          Under the terms of the Acquisition, which will be subject to the Conditions and further terms set out in Appendix 1 to this announcement and to the full terms and conditions that will be set out in the Scheme Document, each Scheme Shareholder at the Scheme Record Time will be entitled to receive:

·          The Offer Price represents:

·          a premium of approximately 23.62 per cent. to the Closing Price of 83.00 pence per DORE Share on 19 June 2025 (being the Latest Practicable Date);

·          a premium of approximately 21.59 per cent. to the volume weighted average price of 84.38 pence per DORE Share for the one-month period ended on 19 June 2025;

·          a premium of approximately 25.31 per cent. to the volume weighted average price of 81.88 pence per DORE Share for the three-month period ended on 19 June 2025;

·          a premium of approximately 25.91 per cent. to the volume weighted average price of 81.49 pence per DORE Share for the twelve-month period ended on 19 June 2025;

·          a discount of approximately 7.46 per cent. to the unaudited net asset value of DORE as at 31 March 2025 of 112.3602 pence per DORE Share (the "31 March 2025 NAV"), adjusted for the Q1 DORE Dividend (as defined below) of 1.4875 pence per DORE Share, resulting in an ex-dividend NAV of 110.8727 pence per DORE Share (the "Ex-Dividend 31 March 2025 NAV"); and

·          a discount of approximately 8.69 per cent. to the 31 March 2025 NAV.

·          The Offer Price values the entire issued ordinary share capital of DORE at approximately £174.55 million.

·          As announced on 20 May 2025, DORE will pay its first quarterly interim dividend in respect of the three months ended 31 March 2025 of 1.4875 pence per DORE Share on or around 27 June 2025 to DORE Shareholders that were on DORE's register of members on 30 May 2025 (the "Q1 DORE Dividend"). DORE Shareholders that were on DORE's register of members at that time will be entitled to receive and retain the Q1 DORE Dividend in full.

·          In addition, Bagnall's board of directors (the "Bagnall Board") and DORE's board of directors (the "DORE Board") have agreed that should the Effective Date of the Scheme fall after 31 August 2025, DORE shall be entitled to declare a special dividend of 0.5 pence per DORE Share, such dividend to be declared and paid prior to the Effective Date (the "Special Dividend" and together with the Q1 DORE Dividend, the "DORE Permitted Dividends"). DORE Shareholders shall be entitled to receive and retain any such Special Dividend (in addition to the Q1 DORE Dividend) without any corresponding reduction to the consideration payable by Bidco for each Scheme Share under the Acquisition.

·          For information on the impact of any other dividend and/or other distribution made or declared by DORE subsequent to this announcement on the Offer Price, see paragraph 10 in the body of this announcement below.

·          As set out below, Bidco has received indications of support in the form of irrevocable undertakings and letters of intent from Scheme Shareholders, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 16.76 per cent. of DORE's issued ordinary share capital (excluding any shares held in treasury) and approximately 22.54 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares (being those Scheme Shares eligible to vote at the Court Meeting), in each case as at the Latest Practicable Date.

·          Bidco is a newly-incorporated company formed at the direction of Bagnall for the purposes of the Acquisition. Bagnall held 25.35 per cent. of DORE's issued ordinary share capital (excluding any shares held in treasury) as at the Latest Practicable Date (and is eligible to vote at the General Meeting but not at the Court Meeting). Bagnall was established in 2013, and its principal activity is to invest in the acquisition, development and operation of energy generation and infrastructure assets, and to make loans to energy and infrastructure businesses through its trading entities. Bagnall aims to preserve capital and deliver a steady return to its investors through income generation and capital appreciation. Downing LLP (the "Investment Manager") acts as discretionary investment manager to Bagnall and also provides certain administrative services to Bagnall. The Investment Manager also acts as investment manager to DORE.

·          In accordance with the requirements of Rule 29 of the Code, Appendix 4 to this announcement contains a valuation report in respect of DORE's portfolio of renewable energy infrastructure assets from Forvis Mazars LLP confirming the valuation as at 31 March 2025 prepared by the Investment Manager in connection with the 31 March 2025 NAV published by DORE on 20 June 2025. The valuation report will also be included in the Scheme Document.

Background to, and reasons for, the Acquisition

·          Bagnall is a long-term private investor with a diverse portfolio of investments in renewable energy infrastructure assets. Bagnall has significant experience in the renewable energy infrastructure sector as it is already a substantial investor in solar power, wind power, hydropower and battery storage across the UK and Northern Europe. Bagnall has invested in renewable energy infrastructure assets since 2013 and its portfolio contains 8,649 renewable generation assets across 118 holdings.

·          The Bagnall Board believes that renewable energy infrastructure will be one of the most impactful and lasting investment themes in the foreseeable future, and DORE's renewable energy infrastructure assets are a compelling long-term investment opportunity that enhance portfolio diversification, and enable investors to capitalise on the growing renewable energy sector. Alongside these benefits, renewable energy infrastructure assets help to reduce the impact of climate change through the generation of clean electricity, appealing to investors who are conscious of the environmental and the social impact of their investments.

·          As DORE's largest shareholder since DORE's IPO, the Bagnall Board is pleased by the progress made by DORE so far under the management of the Investment Manager. However, the adverse macroeconomic backdrop affecting DORE and many other alternative funds in the UK investment trust sector has resulted in DORE's shares consistently trading at a discount to DORE's NAV per share since the end of September 2022. The Bagnall Board believes that there can be no certainty or expectation that this discount can be materially reduced or for the DORE Share price to exceed the Offer Price in the medium-term.

·          The significant and persistent discount to NAV over the past 12 months has prevented DORE from issuing new shares to reach a more meaningful scale, and has deterred buyers in the secondary market. The Bagnall Board believes that DORE's lack of scale currently presents a structural disadvantage and may impact DORE's efficiency and appeal, with higher operating costs reducing net returns for investors, limited liquidity deterring institutional investors and a lack of scale restricting DORE's ability to make new acquisitions. All of these factors may further hinder DORE's efforts to address its persistent discount to NAV.

·          The Bagnall Board wishes to maintain and increase Bagnall's exposure to DORE's portfolio and strategy and believes that DORE will achieve greater success as a private vehicle. The privatisation of DORE will also deliver immediate value crystallisation to DORE's existing shareholders. Bagnall is well placed to support DORE's existing portfolio as both companies have been managed by the Investment Manager since inception.

Background to, and reasons for, the DORE Directors' recommendation of the Offer

·          DORE has returned one of the highest NAV total return rates (including dividends reinvested) in the listed renewable energy infrastructure sector over the last three years to 31 December 2024. Since IPO, DORE has generated a NAV total return (including dividends reinvested) of 36.2 per cent. to 31 March 2025 (inclusive of the Q1 DORE Dividend announced on 20 May 2025), equivalent to an annualised NAV total return of 7.1 per cent., against the medium-term target of 6.5 to 7.5 per cent. per annum set out at DORE's IPO.

·          The DORE Shares began trading at a share price discount to NAV from the end of 2022, prompting the DORE Board to initiate share buybacks in March 2023 as part of a broader effort to narrow the discount, which culminated in a significant buyback programme returning £12 million to shareholders, equivalent to approximately 7.9 per cent. of DORE's issued share capital at the time the programme commenced.

·          Despite these efforts and the Investment Manager's successful execution of the investment strategy, DORE has continued to experience a prolonged dislocation of its share price from its NAV per share and NAV performance. During this period, UK-listed alternative investment trusts have experienced widening share price discounts to NAV, owing to elevated interest rates, weaker investor sentiment, fund reallocation away from alternative assets, and declining asset valuations. As at the Latest Practicable Date, the market capitalisation weighted average share price discount to NAV in the UK-listed renewable energy infrastructure sector was approximately 27 per cent., significantly wider than the sector's market capitalisation weighted average share price premium of approximately 10 per cent. at the end of December 2020, shortly after DORE was launched.

·          The DORE Board believes that the negative impact of the external headwinds on the renewable energy infrastructure sector has at times disproportionately affected DORE's share price discount to NAV given DORE's small size, relatively low trading volumes, and lack of ability to issue new shares.

·          In March 2025, DORE received an unsolicited indicative all-cash proposal from Bagnall regarding a possible offer for the entire issued, and to be issued, ordinary share capital of DORE not already owned by Bagnall. Following negotiation between the parties, the terms of the proposal were revised and improved.

·          In assessing the Offer, the DORE Board considered DORE's prospects as a standalone subscale investment trust, feedback from major shareholders, and Bagnall's position as DORE's largest shareholder.

·          As the DORE Board retains its confidence in the Investment Manager and DORE's strategy, in the absence of the Acquisition, which is at a material premium to the share price, the DORE Board would be inclined to recommend to shareholders that DORE continue in its present form. The DORE Board believes that DORE's share price discount to NAV does not fairly reflect the DORE portfolio's value, performance or longer-term prospects. However, it also acknowledges that various risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond DORE's control, are likely to persist in the short to medium-term. These factors may continue to weigh on the future share rating and, by extension, shareholder returns.

·          In reaching its conclusion, the DORE Board has considered that the Offer Price of 102.6016 pence per DORE Share represents a 23.62 per cent. premium to the Closing Price of 83.00 pence per DORE Share on 19 June 2025 (being the Latest Practicable Date) and a 7.46 per cent. discount to the Ex-Dividend 31 March 2025 NAV. The DORE Board considers the Ex-Dividend 31 March 2025 NAV to be a more appropriate comparator to the Offer Price than the 31 March 2025 NAV which includes the Q1 DORE Dividend. Accordingly, following careful consideration of the above factors, the DORE Board has concluded that the Offer is in the best interests of DORE's shareholders as a whole.

Recommendation

·          The DORE Directors, who have been so advised by Singer Capital Markets as to the financial terms of the Offer, consider the terms of the Offer to be fair and reasonable. In providing its advice to the DORE Directors, Singer Capital Markets has taken into account the commercial assessments of the DORE Directors. Singer Capital Markets is providing independent financial advice to the DORE Directors for the purposes of Rule 3 of the Code.

·          The DORE Directors intend to unanimously recommend that Scheme Voting Shareholders vote (or procure the vote) in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and DORE Shareholders vote (or procure the vote) in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting (or, in the event that the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, to accept or procure acceptance of the Takeover Offer), as they have irrevocably undertaken to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings of, in aggregate, 401,085 DORE Shares, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 0.23 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of DORE (excluding any shares held in treasury) and approximately 0.31 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares (being those Scheme Shares eligible to vote at the Court Meeting), in each case as at the Latest Practicable Date.

Irrevocable undertakings and letters of intent

·          Bidco has received commitments and indications of support for the Acquisition from DORE Shareholders in respect of 28,526,111 DORE Shares, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 16.76 per cent. of DORE's issued ordinary share capital (excluding any shares held in treasury) and approximately 22.54 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares, in each case as at the Latest Practicable Date.

·          These commitments and indications comprise irrevocable undertakings in respect of 13,850,934 DORE Shares, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 10.94 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares and non-binding letters of intent in respect of 14,675,177 DORE Shares which represent, in aggregate, approximately 11.60 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares, in each case as at the Latest Practicable Date.

·          The irrevocable undertakings include irrevocable undertakings received from each of the DORE Directors who hold DORE Shares to vote (or procure the vote): (i) in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting; and (ii) in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting (or, in the event that the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, to accept or procure acceptance of the Takeover Offer) in respect of their entire respective beneficial holdings of Scheme Shares. In aggregate, this represents 401,085 DORE Shares, being all of the DORE Shares currently beneficially held by such DORE Directors and approximately 0.31 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date.

·          These commitments and undertakings also include irrevocable undertakings received from T.Choithram & Sons, Human Capability Foundation and Downing Sustainable Investments I, and non-binding letters of intent from Hawksmoor Investment Management, FS Wealth Management and Tyndall Investment Management, in each case to vote (or to procure the vote) (i) in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and (ii) in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting (or, in the event that the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, to accept or procure acceptance of the Takeover Offer) in respect of their entire respective beneficial holdings of Scheme Shares. In aggregate, such irrevocable undertakings represent 13,449,849 DORE Shares and approximately 10.63 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date. The non-binding letters of intent represent, in aggregate, 14,675,177 DORE Shares and approximately 11.60 per cent. of the Scheme Voting Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date.

·          Further details of the irrevocable undertakings (including the circumstances in which they may lapse) and the non-binding letters of intent are set out in Appendix 3 to this announcement.

Conditions, timetable and valuation report

·          It is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act. However, Bidco reserves the right to elect (with the consent of the Panel and subject to the terms of the Co-operation Agreement) to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer.

·          The Acquisition will be subject to the Conditions and certain further terms set out in Appendix 1 to this announcement and to the full terms and conditions that will be set out in the Scheme Document. The Conditions include, amongst other things: (i) the approval of Scheme Voting Shareholders at the Court Meeting and the passing of the Resolutions at the General Meeting; (ii) the sanction of the Scheme by the Court; (iii) the Scheme becoming Effective by no later than the Long Stop Date; and (iv) certain regulatory clearance conditions, as set out in paragraphs 3.1 - 3.4 of Part A of Appendix 1 to this announcement.

·          In order to become Effective, the Scheme must be approved by a majority in number of Scheme Voting Shareholders representing at least 75 per cent. of the voting rights of Scheme Voting Shareholders, in each case present and voting, either in person or by proxy, at the Court Meeting and at any separate class meeting which may be required by the Court or at any adjournment of such meeting.

·          It is expected that the Scheme Document, containing full details of the Scheme and notices of the Court Meeting and General Meeting, together with the Forms of Proxy, will be sent to DORE Shareholders within 28 days of this announcement (or such later time as DORE, Bidco and the Panel may agree).

·          Subject to the satisfaction or, where applicable, waiver of the Conditions, it is expected that the Scheme will become Effective in the third or early in the fourth quarter of 2025. An expected timetable of principal events relating to the Acquisition will be provided in the Scheme Document.

·          For the purposes of Rule 29.1(d) of the Code, a valuation report in respect of DORE's portfolio from Forvis Mazars LLP confirming the valuation as at 31 March 2025 prepared by the Investment Manager in connection with the 31 March 2025 NAV published by DORE on 20 June 2025 is set out in Appendix 4 to this announcement and will also be included in the Scheme Document (or, if applicable, the Offer Document). For the purposes of Rule 29.5 of the Code, the DORE Board confirms that Forvis Mazars LLP has confirmed to it that an updated valuation of DORE's portfolio of renewable energy infrastructure assets as at the date of this announcement would not be materially different from the valuation as at 31 March 2025 confirmed by Forvis Mazars LLP in the valuation report set out in Appendix 4 to this announcement.

Commenting on the Acquisition, Hugh Little, DORE's Chair, said:

"DORE has consistently delivered on its investment strategy resulting in a strong NAV and dividend performance since IPO. Despite this, and the proactive steps taken by the Board to narrow its share price discount in recent years, the sustained horizon of economic and macro uncertainty has weighed on the share price, which has also limited the opportunities for further raising of new capital, and which may stretch into the mid to long-term. The Board of DORE considers the certainty of the offer by Bidco, at a significant premium to the closing share price, to be fair and in the best interest of shareholders."

Commenting on the Acquisition, James Watson, Bagnall's Chair, said:

"We are firm believers in the transformative power of renewable energy infrastructure, and the acquisition of DORE aligns perfectly with Bagnall's long-term vision and commitment to the sector. However, given challenging public market conditions and DORE's current lack of scale, we believe that the acquisition will enable it to achieve greater scale, success and operational efficiency. For too long, DORE's true value has not been reflected in its share price, and today's offer represents an attractive opportunity for DORE Shareholders to immediately crystallise value."

Key Points:
• The round led by Eneco Ventures brings total funding to over EUR 40m
• Existing investors SE Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Adjacent, Übermorgen and J12 also participated

Details:
Ostrom, a Germany-based green energy and electricity retailer, has raised EUR 20m in Series B funding round led by Eneco Ventures.

Ostrom, the German digital green energy provider committed to making energy smarter, fairer, and greener, today announced a €20 million Series B funding in a round led by Eneco Ventures. The venture capital arm of Dutch sustainable energy leader Eneco was joined by returning investors SE Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Adjacent, Übermorgen and J12. This new investment round brings total funding in Ostrom to over €40 million.

Founded in Berlin in 2021, Ostrom combines full transparency, monthly cancellable contracts, and effortless switching with 100 % certified green electricity. A certified B Corp™, Ostrom is known for its exceptional digital-first customer experience.

The Series B follows Ostrom’s fast growth in 2024, highlighted by a tripling of its customer base, and the launch of the largest electric vehicle Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in Germany. Ostrom is redefining what an energy provider is with its SimplyFair and SimplyDynamic products, offering consumers electricity-at-cost and hourly dynamic pricing. Customers can seamlessly manage their contracts and smart devices via the Ostrom App.

“We are excited to support Ostrom on their growth journey. Their rapid customer adoption and digital-first approach set a new standard for energy retailers. And Ostrom is a true pioneer in unlocking residential flexibility — delivering real value to consumers, accelerating the adoption of renewable energy, and strengthening grid stability.”

Jan van der Velde, Investment Director at Eneco Ventures

Ostrom will use the fresh capital to accelerate its nationwide rollout through subsidizing smart meters for its customers enabling demand-side flexibility, and to strengthen its leading position in automation by expanding its tech capabilities. Already, Ostrom’s investment in AI means that more than half of customer operations are resolved automatically, empowering a lean, highly efficient team structure ready to scale further.

The company also plans to rapidly grow its innovative NeoGrid™ Virtual Power Plant, connecting household devices and electric vehicle batteries to intelligently balance the grid, maximize renewable energy use, and reduce customer costs.

"This Series B funding round represents more than just capital — it's about strategic partnership. Eneco brings deep industry expertise while Ostrom maintains full independence, strengthening our platform as we accelerate smart meter adoption and scale our virtual power plant. With a clear focus on medium-term profitability, we are driving the transformation of the energy market."

Matthias Martensen, Co-Founder & CEO of Ostrom

This Series B represents a critical milestone in Ostrom’s vision to build Europe’s smartest and most sustainable energy platform — leveraging cutting-edge automation, actionable data, and deep dedication to sustainability.

“Combining Eneco’s energy veterancy with Ostrom’s relentless product and customer focus enables us to use AI as a powerful multiplier for rapidly prototyping and releasing new products, already solving 50% of customer requests through AI, and allowing our small, highly capable teams to stay agile, innovative, and execution-driven.”

24. Santander could use part of its available EUR 3.2bn on acquisitions, including repurchase of 10% of Brazil unit - report (translated)

Key Points:
• EUR 6.4bn capital buffer after Polish unit sale, 50% for share buybacks
• Complementary acquisitions planned, not transformational ones
• Brazil unit stake buyback speculated, valued at EUR 1.7bn

Details:
Banco Santander has EUR 3.2bn available to invest that it could use for acquisitions, including the repurchase of 10% of its Brazilian unit, Expansion reported without citing sources.

Santander has a capital buffer of EUR 6.4bn after the sale of its Polish unit, the item said. Of this amount, the bank has already committed 50% in share buybacks. The remaining EUR 3.2bn could be used for acquisitions, organic growth or share buybacks, the report said.

The potential purchases would be complementary corporate transactions, not transformational, Santander's chairwoman Ana Botín said last month.

According to the report, the market speculates about a possible buyback of its division in Brazil. Mario Leao, CEO of the group's Brazilian unit, reportedly raised this scenario in a recent meeting with analysts, the item said. Some financial sources said this transaction would not be decided now and Santander could consider it as an option for the future rather than in the short term, the report said, noting that the 10% of Santander Brazil held by third party investors is worth EUR 1.7bn on the stock market.

The market is also hinting about possible purchases in the US, the report went on.

The bank could also submit an offer for TSB, Banco Sabadell's subsidiary in the UK, as reported.

25. Metro Bank majority owner Gilinski considers sale of stake – report

Key Points:
• Pollen Street, BC Partners' joint bid rejected over valuation dispute
• Gilinski explores options, including merger with another lender
• Metro Bank valued at GBP 844m, shares at 125.8 pence

Details:
Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal may sell his majority stake in Metro Bank after receiving investor interest, a newswire reported.

Reuters, citing multiple sources close to the situation, reported that Gilinski, who owns 52.87% stake in Metro Bank via Spaldy Investments, is exploring options for his holding, including a sale.

This consideration follows a rebound in the bank's share price. Gilinski became the majority shareholder after a pivotal role in Metro Bank's GBP 325m equity recapitalization in 2023.

According to two sources, private equity firms Pollen Street Capital and BC Partners jointly submitted a bid for Metro Bank in recent weeks. However, they halted their efforts following a valuation dispute and the board’s decision to reject their proposal, the report added citing one of the sources.

One potential option for Gilinski is expanding Metro Bank through a merger with another lender, the item noted.

Metro Bank ended Thursday’s trading with its shares priced at 125.8 pence each, bringing its total market capitalization to GBP 844m.

A potential acquisition by Pollen Street and BC Partners, who own British specialist lender Shawbrook, might have resulted in a merger between Metro Bank and the specialist lender. The firms had previously considered a bid for Metro Bank in 2023, the report concluded.

Metro Bank, Pollen Street Capital, BC Partners, and a representative of Gilinski declined the newswire's comment request, while there was no response from Shawbrook to the newswire's request for comment.

27. Unigestion seeks to allocate across Fund I and Fund II GPs to find tomorrow's champions

Key Points:
• Held EUR 275m first close for emerging managers fund-of-funds last month
• LPs turning to smaller GPs as large-cap returns disappoint
• Interested in spin-outs, sector specialists, short-duration funds

Details:
Amid a muted dealmaking environment, Unigestion is doubling down on backing hungry and entrepreneurial emerging champions that want to revitalise and innovate the future of private equity, Kim Pochon, global head of primary investments told Mergermarket.

Unigestion boasts over 30 years of experience backing hundreds of early market entrants and holds a legacy of investing in EQT’s and Francisco Partners’ first funds.

In 2019, it launched a dedicated Emerging Manager Choice (EMC) fund-of-funds programme to address growing LP demand for differentiated private equity strategies and improved fund economics.

The Switzerland-headquartered manager held a EUR 275m first close ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1z2yAU_DXihodvSQcOdlyn6Uzci3OwbwieZBIJqYCcj1_fkdJpc-mFgfdgd9m3xs7Rp6cE8cFpudtJJrYMV7vtHgtBCK7v9jWmbEclq2hJKoXMNPXemuzHoMOYffvnkJCNPkP05rtJV82FJWVjqStbXlbSlYq0sjSKCNaIhtbIzn2eI9yNDjQEfL9DTjvCG4WcT5PJ9gpubzJoRpjERGHGT0QVfCvFumy44BcEmpaSKEVVLRCEm-79DdBVC-V4SbmwFKpKuUZWlConSkqhogoU8isuUYwTJYUUG1EzInlbGV43JeW8EGSA2EEcTHyBvLHjgHw6Qcq6NX0C1OtrzlMq-LZgh4IdXl9fN3PwHaTFjuV-wQ4-JN9dcyrY4V8PmxDGOVhIOPkurBaGjFsfU8a2HxPgscU-JwyDxd573M7BYQsDhOxDt7Z6MG7ZT2PyK6gPGBbFS3EwwXQQsQ-3hTJ0BTugYTH1wemfpwd2OT3Jy-lRHtmZX56_8cvzWTzeH_sze6LH55eP48cPfz69FHz_-ez0PoF26wfQFEc326y_2rMUW9_DkqK6YcZJaVxNFCGEMmU5YQz9miG-r-FQxHJwDIAwWVeUSa6sFQ03orakoS2K2gQXIW0i-A4nex28y4UgV4jmbTIxB4hpHUnWf5kLvv8vd4Zh6k1e9H2VjTO8ZTR_xp8RQhUvuUQ3zX4HAAD__7XAADk ) last month for its EMC III offering, representing more than two-thirds of its EUR 400m target, as per its press release.

“We’ve always believed returns and innovation come from newly set-up managers,” Pochon said. Roughly 40% of Unigestion’s primary commitments are allocated to emerging managers, which it defines as sponsors in Fund I or II, Pochon said.

The EMC strategy is sector-agnostic, and Unigestion seeks spin-outs from established, hard-to-access GPs, as well as sector specialists applying differentiated strategies.

Unigestion’s approach to manager selection typically centres around identifying experienced investment professionals setting up their own shops who are highly incentivised to succeed. “When you back a Fund I, the alignment is very pure. If it fails, there’s no plan B,” Pochon said.

LP fatigue for large-cap players

Even in a tough fundraising climate, interest in emerging managers remains buoyant, said Pochon.

Many LPs, particularly institutional types, have grown disillusioned with large-cap managers’ muted liquidity and returns in recent years. They have increasingly tended to have a more positive perception towards mid- and lower-mid market names, he said.

“A lot of LPs told us it made sense to go back to private equity’s roots: hungry, nimble, entrepreneurial fund managers,” Pochon said.

The sponsor has also fielded strong interest from LPs seeking access to tomorrow’s flagship managers. “Our LPs know that by partnering with us, they can build relationships with the next breakout GPs before they’re oversubscribed,” he added.

Geographically, EMC III’s first close was dominated by European institutional investors, though Unigestion also saw strong appetite from family offices and expects further international diversification by final close.

The sponsor will typically target four to five commitments a year through this vehicle, aiming for 12 to 15 managers over EMC III’s three-year investment period. It will split its US and European deployment on a fifty-fifty basis.

Fund III has already started deploying, but Pochon declined to disclose how many managers have been backed so far or what ticket sizes were involved.

Backing innovation with better alignment and terms

Beyond strategy differentiation and alignment, Unigestion is also able to negotiate favourable terms from emerging managers, who often offer lower management fees, reduced carried interest, or preferential co-investment opportunities.

“We’ve cracked the code,” Pochon said. “Even with a fund-of-funds structure, our total expense ratio is comparable to a normal direct fund commitment.”

To effectively compete in this challenging fundraising market, the firm has also invested in and encouraged managers to consider launching short-duration funds, which are vehicles with seven-year fund lives. While investments are often more concentrated and the asset holds are shorter – within the range of two to three years – one great exit can repay the fund, and the fee benefits are meaningful, Pochon said.

Pochon said they encourage fund managers to slash – sometimes by half – their fundraising target and invest in a lower number of companies.

“This requires a different type of due diligence, but the fee benefit is there. And, when the portfolio’s more concentrated – and we’ve seen a lot of success with this – one very strong exit can repay the entire fund,” he said.

Aside from short-duration funds, the EMC platform can also target co-investments and late primaries.

As for what makes a high-conviction pick, Pochon distilled it to a simple formula: “We ask ourselves, am I better off with this emerging manager than with an established GP in this strategy? More often than not, the answer is yes, because no one else is doing what they’re doing.”

Unigestion launched its first pure-play emerging manager fund – EMC I – in 2018 and followed this with the launch of EMC II in 2022.

The fund was already 50% deployed and was likely to comprise 80-100 underlying companies through 10-12 fund investments, complemented by 10-15 direct co-/secondary investments, according to its press release.

At the time, EMC II was already delivering on its no J-curve promise, the firm said, having exited its J-curve six months after its first close and posting a TVPI of 1.46x gross (1.42x net) at the final close.

Press release 1:

Affinity Private Wealth Sells Investment Business to Capital International, Focusing on Growth in Private Wealth

Affinity Private Wealth has sold its investment business, APW Investors Limited (APWIL), to Capital International Group. This strategic decision reflects our desire to allow the continued growth and development of the investment team within a business whose structure and focus provides further opportunities aligned with their values and long-term vision. This sale will allow Affinity Private Wealth to focus solely on its core strengths in delivering bespoke private client, trust and fiduciary services.

‍The decision to part with the investment business was not made lightly. We were highly selective in identifying the right business to provide the resources, support, and platform that the investment business’s talented team needs to continue to grow and thrive. Capital International stood out as the perfect fit, offering the tools, expertise, culture and shared commitment to responsible and sustainable investing that will allow the team to achieve its full potential.

‍While we are saddened to part ways with some of the well-known faces who have been instrumental in building Affinity as a whole, we are confident that this move presents exciting new opportunities for them, as well as for both businesses. We look forward to seeing our investment colleagues continue to flourish under Capital International’s brand and leadership.

‍Affinity Private Wealth are excited about the future, with new plans set to be announced in the coming weeks, including the launch of a new jurisdiction that will further expand our global footprint. Importantly, as an owner managed business, we remain firmly committed to staying privately owned, ensuring we continue to offer personalised, client-focused services with the flexibility and independence our clients value.

‍This transition allows both businesses to focus on what they do best, and we look forward to this next chapter as we create new opportunities for our clients, our people and our future.

‍David Stearn, Chief Executive Officer of Affinity Private Wealth“Parting with our Investment team is emotional for us, when we formed Affinity in 2011 we did so as two businesses with one common aim and focus. This is however an incredibly exciting opportunity for the investment team to continue to build and enhance their existing offering with scale. We are delighted to see the investment business pass to great new owners who have a very similar culture and value set, and we have no doubt the team will flourish at Capital. As for Affinity, we will continue to focus on growing and expanding our private client structuring services and look forward to the journey ahead.” ‍

‍Ben Stott, Managing Director of APWIL added;"I am extremely proud to lead our team of talented and dedicated professionals into its new home with Capital International. From our initial interactions with their leadership team, it was obvious that we share a belief in exceptional client delivery, alongside innovative investment solutions. It is exciting to expand our offering for our existing and future clients, who will also benefit from access to Capital’s market leading technology."

‍Anthony Long, Chairman of Capital International Group:"We’ve admired APW Investors for some time, not only for their investment expertise, but also for their leadership in sustainability and commitment to the community. This acquisition is a natural fit with our long-term strategy and values."

‍*Subject to regulatory approval

31. Supernova calls for private equity to expand ‘timid’ foray into deeptech

Key Points:
• More capital key for European deeptech to scale-up
• Sponsor's EUR 100m fund targets 20 deals
• Seeks to expand LP base beyond mostly-France in future

Details:
Although private equity is investing more in European deeptech, its “timid” foray is not creating sufficient capital for companies in the sector to scale-up, managing partner Pierre-Emmanuel Struyven and investment director at Supernova Invest Michaël Thomas said.

‘Deeptech’, or ‘deep technology’, companies offer innovative solutions based on groundbreaking scientific research. The sector can refer to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, as well as quantum computing, biotechnology or robotics.

When Supernova was established in 2017, it was one of the few European deeptech pure-players in the venture capital market alongside Omnes Capital and Jolt Capital, Struyven said.

New players have progressively emerged, but they mostly focus on funding early-stage companies, he said.

The goal is now to support future market leaders, but that requires more exits to materialise, one of the major issues faced by deeptech investors today, he said.

A key challenge for early-stage investors is finding buyers or additional investors for their investments at the necessary multiples, Thomas said. An issue especially relevant considering the limited capital from larger funds flowing into the sector.

The “classic” M&A deal is not the only path, he said, adding that larger funds could join the capital structure and replace early-stage investors on the board.

He named Exotec, a French robotics company, and AI expert Dataiku as companies that saw larger funds taking over historic venture capital investors.

In 2022, Exotec raised ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0UsFu4zoM_Brr5oAiJdk-6JA0L319QPMu7iG5yRLdqHVsr6wUbb9-kXSx6B72QoAEhzODofOXFJenhdNDsHqz0ajWWNab9bZUCqBs7rZNKXEjNdaygtoIN89D9C7HabTjlGP_q1mETzFziu5ft5wsKQ9V52WoeqpqHSoDva6cAYWd6mQj_GXIl8R3U2DLY3m_EcEGoM6IEJfZZX_isHWZLQLqEkyJ1IIpaK3VraxI0VGwlZUGY6RplODxzQ7xjcXJhk6GqpahblD1FffeuL6G3mnpZB1Iini7CwYJjFZarVSDoKmvHTVdJYkKBWdOz5zOLr1yXvnpLOLS8pJt74aFxWBPOc9LQesCdwXu_tiO0-hGN3zk6JcrtMCdn8bMYy5wJwGAGq2pFuer0Ydg_28f8Ng-6WP7qPd4oOPLP3R8OajH-_1wwCe5f3n93H_-Fw_ta0HbL1j7MbMN8ZmXLOY0hYvP9ruI67CPA1-TbTp0QWsXGjAAINF4AkTx48Lp4xaYAU8ckBlQN7VETcZ71ZFTjYdO9iJZN4bEyypxfC4XfzrHkAsFJ07ufXYpj5xuXkW2v5kL2v6VO_N5Hly-6vsuu8z8nsXl6yURQBqqSIs3iz8DAAD__ygE1mE ) USD 335m in a Series D round which valued the business at USD 2bn and led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

The same year, Dataiku ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0UsFu4zoM_Brr5oAiJdk-6JA0L319QPMu7iG5yRLdqHVsr6wUbb9-kXSx6B72QoAEhzODofOXFJenhdNDsHqz0ajWWNab9bZUCqBs7rZNKXEjNdaygtoIN89D9C7HabTjlGP_q1mETzFziu5ft5wsKQ9V52WoeqpqHSoDva6cAYWd6mQj_GXIl8R3U2DLY3m_EcEGoM6IEJfZZX_isHWZLQLqEkyJ1IIpaK3VraxI0VGwlZUGY6RplODxzQ7xjcXJ1rI2gakG2fk6cB1MZWRDwJ5qE1Qt4u0uGCQwWmm1Ug2Cpr521HSVJCoUnDk9czq79Mp55aeziEvLS7a9GxYWgz3lPC8FrQvcFbj7YztOoxvd8JGjX67QAnd-GjOPucCdBCDVNBpJnK9GH4L9v33AY_ukj-2j3uOBji__0PHloB7v98MBn-T-5fVz__lfPLSvBW2_YO3HzDbEZ16ymNMULj7b7yKuwz4OfE226dAFrV1owACAROMJEMWPC6ePW2AGPHFAZkDd1BI1Ge9VR041HjrZi2TdGBIvq8TxuVz86RxDLhScOLn32aU8crp5Fdn-Zi5o-1fuzOd5cPmq77vsMvN7Fpevl0QAaagiLd4s_gwAAP__8-7VtQ ) secured USD 200m in a Series F funding round led by new investor Wellington Management, at a USD 3.7bn valuation.

Fifteen deals to go

This February, Supernova raised EUR 100m for its early-stage deeptech fund Supernova Innovation 3, the successor of EUR 75m vehicle Supernova 2, Stryuven said.

Supernova’s historic investors - CEA Investissement, Crédit Agricole, Bpifrance, bioMérieux, Vinci and Michelin - are among Supernova Innovation 3’s LPs, he said. The vehicle also attracted MACSF as a new investor, he said, adding that around 70% of the fund’s EUR 100m hard cap came from institutional investors.

The firm aims to expand its LP base, which is mostly French today, to the broader European market, Struyven said.

Supernova started to market its fund in mid-2023, Struyven said, adding that the vehicle’s LPs were attracted by the firm’s investment strategy, its deeptech expertise and track record.

Supernova Innovation 3 will pursue around 20 deals, Struyven said. It will deploy in seed or Series A funding rounds and reinvest on average twice in the same business, he added.

The vehicle will pursue two to three deals annually and deploy EUR 1.5m-EUR 2m initially, and up to EUR 7m per portfolio company in total, he said.

It will target European businesses, he said, adding that Supernova has invested in France, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, Denmark, Belgium and Israel. Over the last 18 to 24 months, Supernova invested as much in France as in the rest of Europe, Thomas added.

Profitability is not the only criteria

Supernova deploys in spacetech, digital tech, cleantech, industrial tech and healthtech, Struyven said.

It has lately looked into several software-enabled hardware, including physical AI and autonomous robotics, Thomas said, adding that the firm invested ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1v4zoM_DXWzQFFfdg66JA0L319QPMu7iG5yRLdqHVsr6QUbX_9Iuli0T3shQAJDmcGQ-cvKeanTOkhWLXZKJRrrNvNeltLCVCbu62pOW64wpY30GrmlmWM3pU4T3aaSxx-NZn5FAul6P51-WSF9ND0nodmEE2rQqNhUI3TILGXPTfMX8ZySXQ3B7I01fcbFmwA0WsWYl5c8ScKW1fIIqCqQdcoOtCVWCt5KyshxZGR5Y0Crbk2ktH0Zsf4RuxkB1BODQENB06knTScyA1GDko0bSNYvN0FjQK0kkqupEFQYmidMH3DhagknCk9Uzq79Epl5eczi7mjXOzgxkxstKdSllyJdYW7Cnd_bMd5cpMbP0r0-QqtcOfnqdBUKtxxAMll00hg56vRh2D_7x7w2D2pY_eo9ngQx5d_xPHlIB_v9-MBn_j-5fVz__lfPHSvldh-wbqPhWyIz5QLW9IcLr7Y7yKuwyGOdE3W9OiCUi4Y0ADAUXsBiOzHhdLHLTANXlBAIkBlWo5KaO9lL5w0Hno-sGTdFBLlVaL4XGd_OsdQKgknSu59calMlG5eWbG_mSux_St3ofMyunLV9112Xei9sMvXSyIA16IRir1Z_BkAAP__hCrWAg ) into Zurich-based ANYbotics, an AI-focused robotic inspection solutions company, last December.

When it comes to pure-player software providers, Supernova is attentive to cloud-based, cybersecurity and vertical AI solutions, which are software platforms tailored for a specific industry, he said.

The AI market is “quick” and very capex-intensive but Supernova is keen on investing in the sector and has done so with Gleamer ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uj1v4zoQ_DViJ2O5_JBYsLDj57w8IH6NUtgdRa5iJrKkI-kgya8_2DkccsU1BLjY2ZnZWecvKeanTOkhWLXZKJRrrNvNeltLCVCbu62pOW64wpY30GrmlmWM3pU4T3aaSxx-fTLzKRZK0f3r8skK6aHpPQ_NIJpWhUbDoBqnQWIve26Yv4zlkuhuDmRpqu83LNgAotcsxLy44k8Utq6QRUBVg65RdKArsVby9qyEFEdGljcKtObaSEbTmx3jG7GT1YNutQQTwmAG1Tem6UlAQ9IL03L0LN7mgkYBWkklV9IgKDG0Tpi-4UJUEs6UnimdXXqlsvLzmcXcUS52cGMmNtpTKUuuxLrCXYW7P7rjPLnJjR8l-nyFVrjz81RoKhXuOIBQpkFj2Plq9CHY_7sHPHZP6tg9qj0exPHlH3F8OcjH-_14wCe-f3n93H_-Fw_dayW2X7DuYyEb4jPlwpY0h4sv9ruIa3GII12TNT26oJQLBjQAcNReACL7caH0cQtMgxcUkAhQXVekhPZe9sJJ46HnA0vWTSFRXiWKz3X2p3MMpZJwouTeF5fKROnmlRX7m7kS279yFzovoytXfd9l14XeC7t8nSQCcC0aodibxZ8BAAD__2IV1fY ) in June 2023, he added.

On average, Supernova aims to exit a company after five to seven years when it entered during a seed funding round or Series A, and between three to six years after a Series B, Thomas said.

The firm aims for a two-digit IRR for this vehicle that is well above 10%, Struyven said. Profitability adds value to a company, but it is not the only criterion for investors looking for strong growth, which is reassuring for the venture capital market, Thomas added.

Supernova has more than EUR 800m assets under management (AUM) and plans to reach EUR 1bn AUM next year, Struyven said. It has invested in around 100 companies in total, he added.

It also has an agrifood fund, launched in 2023, which has carried ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0UsFu4zoM_Brr5oAiJdk-6JA0L319QPMu7iG5yRLdqHVsr6wUbb9-kXSx6B72QoAEhzODofOXFJenhdNDsHqz0ajWWNab9bZUCqBs7rZNKXEjNdaygtoIN89D9C7HabTjlGP_q1mETzFziu5ft5wsKQ9V52WoeqpqHSoDva6cAYWd6mQj_GXIl8R3U2DLY3m_EcEGoM6IEJfZZX_isHWZLQLqEkyJ1IIpaK3VraxI0VGwlZUGY6RplODxzQ7xjcXJGlRVTx4b0zeKOkdEoCuqJXcde2YRb3fBIIHRSquVahA09bWjpqskUaHgzOmZ09mlV84rP51FXFpesu3dsLAY7CnneSloXeCuwN0f23Ea3eiGjxz9coUWuPPTmHnMBe4kAJmqQi3F-Wr0Idj_2wc8tk_62D7qPR7o-PIPHV8O6vF-PxzwSe5fXj_3n__FQ_ta0PYL1n7MbEN85iWLOU3h4rP9LuI67OPA12SbDl3Q2oUGDABINJ4AUfy4cPq4BWbAEwdkBtRNLVGT8V515FTjoZO9SNaNIfGyShyfy8WfzjHkQsGJk3ufXcojp5tXke1v5oK2f-XOfJ4Hl6_6vssuM79ncfl6SQSQhirS4s3izwAAAP__biLV_w ) out three investments so far with a fourth underway, he said, declining to give further details.

Without citing a specific source, the German daily said shareholders are expected to approve the 49% spin-off at an EGM on 8 August.

Company sources noted there were still unresolved questions regarding the financing of the project, and added that the role of the federal government has not yet been clarified.

The report said ThyssenKrupp confirmed to the Bild newspaper that it is "in intensive negotiations with the federal government."

The German Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter when asked, the report added.

33. Sidenor makes its entry into Talgo conditional on SEPI entering into shareholding

Key Points:
• SEPI's stake to aid Talgo's EUR 400m debt refinancing with creditor banks

Details:
Sidenor has made its entry into Spain-based railway manufacturer Talgo conditional on SEPI's participation in the capital, El Periodico reported, citing sources familiar with the negotiations.

The aim of José Antonio Jainaga, president of the steel company, is that state-owned SEPI takes a stake of at least 5%, although the target percentage would be 10%, the item said.

With the backing of the state in the shareholding, Talgo would have greater credibility among the pool of more than twenty creditor banks to an enventual refinancing of its more than EUR 400m of debt, the report said.

Sidenor and official sources from SEPI declined to comment on the information, the item noted.

Jainaga's intention is not to close the pre-agreement signed on 14 February until it has been clarified and the groundwork has been laid to resolve the troubled financial situation that Talgo is going through, El Periodico report added.

As reported, Sidenor, has a pre-agreement with the British fund Trilantic to acquire up to 29.7% of the manufacturer Talgo with the backing  of the Basque Government and two banking foundations.

As reported, SEPI has made its entry into Talgo conditional to securing significant management influence, including getting at least one board seat.

34. Hueller Hille owner faces sale pressure from trade union (translated)

Key Points:
• Insolvency proceedings seen as only solution by IG Metall representative
• CEO disputes insolvency need despite significant liabilities
• Huelle Hille faces low employee turnout and substantial two-digit million Euro debt

Details:
The owner of Hueller Hille, a German machine tool manufacturer, is facing pressure from trade union IG Metall to sell the company, Muenchner Merkur reported.

The German-language newspaper quoted IG Metall representative Thomas Bohlender as saying that Hueller Hille is in a dire situation that can only be resolved by insolvency proceedings. He explained that IG Metall wants the Hueller Hille management to pave the way for new investors.

Bingcheng Zhang, the CEO and backer of Hueller Hille, has meanwhile claimed that there was no need to file for insolvency, the report said.

The piece mentioned unconfirmed reports of Hueller Hille having amassed a two-digit million euro sum in liabilities. Only a fraction of the 170 employees are currently turning up for work, it added.

35. IG Metall concerned over Thyssenkrupp CEO contract extension (translated)

Key Points:
• Kerner questions contract extension timing due to unresolved concerns
• IG Metall seeks talks with Křetínský on Thyssenkrupp steel division sale
• Kerner doubts Křetínský is suitable buyer for steel division

Details:
IG Metall second chairman, Jürgen Kerner, has voiced his concerns at the contract extension awarded to Thyssenkrupp CEO Miguel Lopez, Frankfurter Allgemeine reported. The German daily quoted Kerner, who is also deputy chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, as stating after the EGM vote yesterday (20 June) that the order of proceedings is wrong, and it only makes sense to talk about a contract extension once the person in question has delivered. Kerner said this is not the case here, and there are still are major concerns and reservations about this decision.

Regarding the sale of the steel division to Daniel Křetínský's EP Group, the report said Kerner stated earlier this week that he has officially invited Křetínský to talks, but while he always receives a very friendly response that he would like to talk to us at the appropriate time, but is not in a position to comment at present. Kerner said this is not acceptable, and has doubts that Křetínský is the right solution.

36. SAMAG Machine Tools administrator strikes rescue deal with Austrian investor (translated)

Key Points:
• Deal saves 50 jobs at German industrial processing solutions developer
• Wang brings metalworking industry expertise and Chinese customer network
• SAMAG Machine Tools had EUR 14.1m turnover before rescue

Details:
SAMAG Machine Tools, a German industrial processing solutions developer under administration, has struck a rescue deal with Austrian entrepreneur Wei Wang, a press release stated.

The German-language statement said that the creditors have already proved the transaction. It pointed out that the deal saves 50 of 90 jobs at SAMAG Machine Tools.

Wang grew up in Austria as the son of Chinese parents and hails from a family of entrepreneurs in the metalworking industry, the release noted. As a former partner of auditing firm PwC in Germany, he has overseen a number of successful acquisitions in the mechanical engineering sector.

The statement highlighted that Wang has been working as an investor and entrepreneur in the industry since 2019 and has an extensive network of potential customers in China.

SAMAG Machine Tools manufactures machine tools for metal cutting, primarily multi-spindle horizontal CNC machining centres, as well as deep drilling and vertical milling machines, the announcement stated. The company’s most recent turnover was around EUR 14.1m.

SAMAG Machine Tools, which had initially hoped to restructure itself under self-administration, had hired Thorsten Springstub of law firm Tiefenbacher and Simon Leopold of ABG Consulting-Partner as restructuring counsels, as previously reported ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1v2zAM_TXWzQFFfUUHHZJm6Tqg2cU9JDdZohu1ju3JStH01w9Jh6E77EKABB_fe3j04ZzT_DRTfohOrdcK5Qrr5Xq1qaUEqO3dxtYc11zhkhtYauanqU_BlzQObhhL6v40Mws5FcrJf_fz0QkZwLSBR9MJs1TRaOiU8RoktrLlloVzX86Z7sZIjob6fs2iiyBazWKaJ1_CkeLGF3IIqGrQNYoGdCVWSt7KQkhxYOS4UaA111YyGt5cn96IHZ3oDGFH2FpjOm1Ma6GzKKRpQ5BWeZZud0GjAK2kkgtpEZToll7Y1nAhKgknys-UTz6_UlmE8cTS3NBcXOf7mVjvjqVMcyVWFW4r3P6zncbBD76_lBTmK7TCbRiHQkOpcMsBJDdaSslOV6MP0f1sHvDQPKlD86h2uBeHl2_i8LKXj_e7fo9PfPfy-rH7-JH2zWslNp-w5jKRi-mZ5sKmPMZzKO6riOuwSz1dk7Ut-qiUjxY0AHDUQQAi-3WmfLkFpiEIikgEqOySoxI6BNkKL22AlncsOz_ETPMiU3qu53A8pVgqCUfK_n3yuQyUb15ZcX-ZK7H5L3eh09T7ctX3VXZd6L2w8-dLIgDXwgjF3hz-DgAA__-h8dYV ) .

37. thyssenkrupp EGM approves spin-off of TKMS 49%, extends CEO Miguel López's contract by five years

Key Points:
• To list TKMS on Frankfurt Stock Exchange this calendar year
• CEO Miguel López's contract extended by five years until 31 May 2031
• thyssenkrupp AG presents future strategic target model for independent business units

Details:
Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG approves Executive Board’s plans for a stand-alone solution for the marine business – Miguel López’s CEO contract extended by five years

*

Supervisory Board recommends that the shareholders approve the spin-off of a 49 percent minority interest in Marine Systems at an extraordinary general meeting

*

Resolution planned at extraordinary general meeting on August 8, 2025 – aim is to list Marine Systems (TKMS) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange within this calendar year

*

Independence should boost the competitiveness and growth opportunities of TKMS

*

Executive Board presents its future strategic target model for the further development of the group as a whole

*

Top management focuses on continuity in the strategic transformation and improvement in the competitiveness of the company’s businesses

*

Supervisory Board agrees to extend the contract of the CEO of thyssenkrupp AG, Miguel Ángel López Borrego, by five years until May 31, 2031

thyssenkrupp is committed to consistently pressing ahead with the spin-off of the Marine Systems segment (TKMS). At an extraordinary meeting, the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG today approved the Executive Board’s plans to spin off of a minority interest in TKMS. The positioning as a stand-alone listed company should boost the competitiveness and growth opportunities of TKMS in the long term.

The plans involve consolidating the marine business under a new holding company and transferring 49 percent of the TKMS shares to the shareholders of thyssenkrupp AG in proportion to their interest in thyssenkrupp AG. This would make the shareholders of thyssenkrupp AG direct shareholders of TKMS. Through the spin-off, 51 percent – and hence the majority interest – of TKMS remain with thyssenkrupp AG. TKMS thus remains a fully consolidated company in the thyssenkrupp Group. The shareholders of thyssenkrupp AG will be asked to approve the plan at an extraordinary general meeting on August 8, 2025. The aim is to finalize the listing of TKMS on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange within this calendar year.

Prof. Siegfried Russwurm, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG: “TKMS is proof that Germany can set standards worldwide in cutting-edge technologies. The Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG is convinced that TKMS will be best able to exploit the huge growth potential as a global pioneer in the maritime defense industry as an independent entity. We therefore recommend that the shareholders of thyssenkrupp AG approve the spin-off of TKMS at the extraordinary general meeting.”

As the world market leader for non-nuclear submarines, TKMS is one of the leading system providers in the maritime defense industry. With an order backlog at a record level of around 18 billion euros, production at the company will be at full capacity well into the next decade. The long-term geostrategic developments also provide the company with further growth opportunities that will be best leveraged through this independence.

The planned spin-off is consistent with the group’s strategic realignment. thyssenkrupp AG is basically aiming in the medium term to become a strategic holding company with autonomous units, while retaining majority stakes in the businesses. Similar steps were already taken in the past, such as floating the hydrogen subsidiary thyssenkrupp nucera on the stock market.

Future strategic target model for the further development of the group presented

At the extraordinary meeting of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG also presented the current status of its future strategic target model for the further development of the group as a whole, parts of which had become known prematurely in May. The main goal of this strategy is to gradually turn all business units at thyssenkrupp into independent companies and open them up to third-party involvement. Important steps toward this goal have already been taken with the spin-off of a minority interest of Marine Systems at a well-advanced stage and the initiated efforts to create a 50/50 joint venture of Steel Europe with EPG.

Over the coming years, efforts will be made to achieve capital market readiness for the Materials Services and Automotive Technology segments as well and then to make them independent. The relatively young Decarbon Technologies segment is also to be made independent in the future, as soon as the necessary requirements have been met and the market for green technologies permits it. thyssenkrupp AG basically intends to retain a majority stake in the businesses once they have achieved capital market readiness. The goal is to form a focused, agile, and realigned industrial group: thyssenkrupp AG as the strategic holding company with strong, independent businesses.

Contract for CEO Miguel Ángel López Borrego extended by five years

At today’s extraordinary meeting, the Supervisory Board also agreed to extend the contract of the CEO of thyssenkrupp AG, Miguel Ángel López Borrego, by five years until May 31, 2031. Mr. López’s current contract ends at the end of May 2026.

The group is undergoing a challenging and urgently needed transformation process, in which reliability, leadership and clear priorities are of the essence. The extension of Miguel López’s contract is an expression of our confidence in his leadership and our conviction that clear orientation and continuity along the chosen path are crucial to the further progress and future of thyssenkrupp.”

39. US buyers pile into UK-listed corporates in 2Q with more deals expected post-summer - Analysis

Key Points:
• Three US strategic-led deals worth GBP 4.7bn announced in 2Q
• Technology and real estate among sector hotspots

Details:
US buyers are accelerating their pursuit of UK-listed corporates with 2Q25 already among the strongest quarters for transatlantic M&A since 2020, according to Mergermarket data.

This momentum is expected to continue amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, lingering trade tariffs, and appealing UK valuations, with US buyers showing increasing interest in takeovers of London-listed businesses, dealmakers said.

In 2Q25 so far, three deals worth an equity value of GBP 4.7bn have been agreed.

This makes it one of the strongest quarters for US acquisitions of London-listed corporates since the Coronavirus pandemic, exceeded only by 1Q24 (GBP 14.6bn), 3Q21 (GBP 13.9bn) and 4Q20 (GBP 7.1bn).

The total number of UK-listed corporates which have announced deals to be acquired by US buyers in 1H25 is six, at a combined equity value of GBP 6.4bn. This compares to five deals in 1H24 worth GBP 15.4bn, though this includes International Paper's GBP 12.6bn acquisition of DS Smith, which makes up 82% of that period's total deal value.

“Compared to this time last year, I’m encouraged by where we stand,” said Adrian Beidas, Barclays co-head of UK Investment Banking. “Contrary to expectations, market activity has rebounded swiftly, with clients re-engaging far more quickly than we had forecast.”

And that interest looks set to continue. “I [was] really encouraged by the bounce back in May in terms of M&A dialogue,” said Citi UK Head of Investment Banking, James Fleming. “That won’t translate into public announcements perhaps until after the summer because M&A is a very long tail business.”

Rebalancing between strategic and private equity buyers

A growing number of UK-listed companies are attracting interest from both US strategic buyers and US-based private equity sponsors.

San Francisco-based DoorDash’s GBP 2.8bn cash offer for food delivery group Deliveroo represents the largest deal announced so far in 2Q. Also announced in 2Q were US semiconductor group Qualcomm’s GBP 1.8bn offer for Alphawave, and US pawnbroker FirstCash’s GBP 351m offer for H&T Group.

Not included in the figures for 2Q is a potential offer for Alpha Group by New York-listed Corpay, where no price has been disclosed. Corpay’s initial approach was rejected, and it now has until 7 July to announce a firm offer for Alpha Group, which has a current market capitalisation of GBP 1.3bn.

“This year, we are seeing a rebalancing towards an even split between US strategic buyers and financial buyers bidding for UK assets,” said Sonica Tolani, Public M&A Partner at White & Case, who noted that last year’s activity was mainly driven by private equity.

“US strategics will act when it makes sense,” added Kate Cooper, M&A Partner at Freshfields. “They’ve benefited from a strong dollar, solid economic performance, and significant firepower.”

While not classified as cross-border transactions by Mergermarket data, US financial sponsors have continued to remain active in public-to-private deals on the London market.

Recent examples include Advent and KKR’s separate approaches for UK instrumentation and control specialist Spectris. KKR’s proposal has been rejected by Spectris, while its board said it was minded to recommend Advent’s GBP 3.7bn equity value offer.

Advent has until 7 July to firm up its offer, while KKR has until 11 July to make an offer under UK Put Up or Shut Up (PUSU) rules.

KKR is also vying for UK healthcare REIT Assura.

Together with Stonepeak, KKR has bid GBP 1.7bn for Assura but is facing a competing bid from Assura’s UK-listed rival Primary Health Properties.

“Looking mostly at activity post-summer, I’m seeing an increase in public-to-privates,” said Fleming.

“The financial sponsor community have got a lot of capital to commit and we’re being asked to look at a lot of P2Ps.”

He added that US private equity firms are specifically looking at companies that have a proportion, or a high proportion, of their earnings from the US and where they think that the asset could relist in the US in a number of years’ time.

Valuation gaps, sector hotspots

Beyond macroeconomic drivers, valuation gaps between UK and US companies are continuing to attract inbound interest.

Although the dollar has depreciated against sterling in recent months, it is still trading at relatively historically high levels, said Patrick Sarch, Head of UK Public M&A at White & Case.

And, while UK equities have performed well recently – in particular the FTSE 250, where much of the deal activity is – UK corporates continue to trade at much lower multiples than US equivalents, he explained.

“This combination continues to make US inbound acquisitions into the UK attractive,” Sarch said.

Cooper pointed out that interest isn’t limited to the main market.

“There’s also a lot of interest in AIM companies, which have struggled for many years to attract strong valuations, and investors there are looking for exits," she said.

Dealmakers report strong interest from US buyers across several sectors, particularly technology, real estate, industrials and financial services.

Sarch said he continues to see “a high level of interest from US buyers for technology businesses” and expects this trend to carry on through the rest of the year.

Real estate is another standout sector. The competitive bid battle for UK healthcare landlord Assura demonstrates the appeal of the sector.

Usman Khan, Private Capital Real Assets Partner at McDermott, Will & Emery, said a "confluence of factors” is driving US interest in UK-listed real estate, including valuations that remain materially discounted to Net Asset Value (NAV) and the foreign-exchange dynamic.

“For platforms with long-income characteristics, like healthcare, logistics or specialist infrastructure, the yield profile is especially appealing in a rate environment that’s now starting to ease. The UK public real estate sector also offers transparent governance and liquidity not always available elsewhere,” he said.

Fleming said industrials and financial services are “likely to be the bulk of the focus,” but emphasised that activity is “quite broad” across various sectors.

That meeting is expected to approve the issuance of up to 200 million new shares to be used in MFE’s public offer for ProSiebenSat.1.

Currently, MFE’s offer comprises EUR 729m in cash and 66 million MFE Class A shares—equivalent to 0.4 MFE shares for each ProSiebenSat.1 share. The report noted that this share component could increase to 1.2 MFE shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share.

If the 31 July EGM approves the issuance of an additional 500 million shares, the share component of the offer would rise to 3.03 MFE shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share. Including the cash component, this would bring the total value of the offer to EUR 14.10 per share.

According to the report, MFE called two EGMs to maintain maximum flexibility in responding to a competing bid from Czech investment group PPF, which has launched a partial all-cash offer of EUR 7 per share. PPF aims to increase its stake in the German media group from 15% to 29.9%.

Both the MFE and PPF offers are set to expire on 13 August, the report added.

Impact Partners acquires a minority stake in Grupo Aire Limpio

The European fund Impact Partners has acquired a minority stake in Grupo Aire Limpio, a Spanish company specializing in environmental wellbeing and sustainability in built environments. Advised by Abante, this capital increase represents an injection of EUR 8m, providing the Group with the necessary resources to accelerate its business growth plan over the next five years.

“Impact Partners has fully trusted our strategic plan since the very beginning of the deal, and throughout the process they have consistently emphasized the importance of respecting the autonomy of our project,” explains Tomás Higuero, co-founder and CEO of Grupo Aire Limpio.

As such, the executive partners of the Group will retain the majority stake and continue to lead management across the various business areas in which they operate. Impact Partners’ objective is to support Grupo Aire Limpio in consolidating its position as a leader in services for healthy and sustainable buildings.

With 26 years of history, Grupo Aire Limpio has experienced strong growth since the start of this decade, doubling its revenues to reach EUR 17.2m in 2024, with EBITDA of EUR 2.3m. With over 140 employees, the Group serves more than a thousand clients across 8 countries, with offices in Madrid, Barcelona, and Santiago de Compostela.

“We saw major business opportunities emerging from the profound transformation the real estate sector is undergoing, particularly in the demanding areas of decarbonization, health and wellbeing, and the fight against building obsolescence,” says Tomás Higuero. “And since our goal is to be involved throughout the entire lifecycle of various asset types—hospitals, schools, offices, hotels, data centers, residential, leisure, industrial, healthcare, pharmaceutical industry, logistics, etc.—scaling up was essential, both organically and inorganically.”

In this context, the executive shareholders of Grupo Aire Limpio evaluated different partners for this next stage of growth until they found the perfect match in Impact Partners. This European investment fund focuses on companies that contribute to a fair transition toward a decarbonized economy, with special attention to balancing social and economic factors—a philosophy closely aligned with Grupo Aire Limpio’s business purpose.

“We see in Aire Limpio a company with a unique positioning in the Spanish market, offering solutions that respond to the new market demands and boasting strong potential for growth and consolidation,” says Mathieu Cornieti, CEO of Impact Partners. “More than 50% of the beneficiaries of the company’s solutions are hospital patients and schoolchildren, which speaks volumes about the Group’s social impact,” adds Nicolas Touboulic, Managing Partner of Impact Partners Iberica.

Environmental Wellbeing and Sustainability in Built Environments

Today, the Group operates a highly specialized brand structure—Aura, Aire Limpio, Ambisalud, Commtech, and ACSOS—allowing it to cover key areas related to building decarbonization and control, environmental wellbeing of properties, commissioning, optimal performance of systems, audits, validations, and analytics of indoor air and water quality, as well as verification and measurement services for certifications such as WELL, LEED, BREEAM, or DGNB.

Their solutions help buildings and their systems become healthier and more environmentally friendly, while also boosting asset performance to minimize both carbon footprint and operating costs.

Formed by Aura, Aire Limpio, Ambisalud, Commtech, and ACSOS, the Group’s structure of highly specialized companies allows it to deliver top-quality service across key areas such as building decarbonization and control, environmental wellbeing, commissioning, system performance, indoor air and water quality audits and analyses, and certification services including WELL, LEED, BREEAM, and DGNB.

45. Interest in Evalueserve cools - report (translated)

Key Points:
• Initial private equity interest cools noticeably
• Evalueserve valued at USD 400m in sale led by Rothschild

Details:
Buyer interest in Evalueserve, a Swiss data and insights analytics service provider, has cooled, Finanz und Wirtschaft reported, citing several people familiar with the situation. The unnamed sources said interest has cooled noticeably due to the increased use of artificial intelligence, which could potentially make the further outsourcing of individual work steps and projects obsolete.

The report said that initially, investors such as Blackstone, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs were among those interested, while one source said Partners Group had also been interested but had since withdrawn. Possible bidders also include mid-market investors such as Bregal Unternehmerkapital (BU) and Montagu.

Permira, which already owns Evalueserve's competitor Acuity Knowledge Partners, has also looked at the company, the report said.

The report said Rothschild is leading the sale, which values the company at around USD 400m (EUR 347m).

Key Points:
• Two PE firms compete for acquisition at CHF 200m-300m
• Houlihan Lokey advises on sale, multiple PE firms interested
• Globegarden denies sale talk

Details:
Globegarden, the Swiss childcare operator, is close to a sale, Finanz und Wirtschaft, citing unnamed sources.

The Swiss bi-weekly said it had learned from the sources that initial offers have been received. One source said two private equity firms are in the running to acquire the company for a price expected to be between CHF 200m and CHF 300m. The report said Houlihan Lokey has been entrusted with the mandate.

Potential buyers could include Bregal Unternehmerkapital (BU), ICG, Bridgepoint and Cinven, according to the report. The newly founded Jacobs Capital could also be among the interested parties, the report stated.

Partners Group, BU and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment. Globegarden denied sale rumours, stating on request that the company will always remain 100% family-owned.

Denholm (“the Denholm Group”) on its recent acquisition of WPA Construction Group Ltd and its trading subsidiary Weatherproofing Advisors Ltd (“WPA”).

WPA is a leading UK commercial roofing contractor with more than 30 years of industry expertise. The business is focused on both commercial and industrial refurbishment projects, operating from premises across the UK, including Glasgow, Newcastle, Merseyside, London and Bristol.

Founded over 150 years ago, the Denholm Group ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0kstu4zoMhp_G2jmgqYvthRZJc9rTAZrZuItkJ0t0rMa3keTenn6QdDDoZjYESID8P_KnsWvw8TlSeHRa7nYSxRbzarfd50IA5PXdvs4L3BUSq6KESjGzLIO3Jvl50tOcfPcnicwGnyh487-JvebCQtnawpUdLyvpSgWdLI0Cga1oi5rZdUhroLvZkaYpf9gxpx3wVjHn42KS7cntTSKNgDIHlSNvQGV8K8UtbLjgJ0a6KCUoVahaMJpe9eBfifUabGdN2SJxK7racsNdZdoKSgWIdSuYv80FhRyUFFJsRI0geVcZXrdlwXkmYKRwpjCacKG0sfPIfGwoJt2ZIRIbdJ_SEjO-zfA-w_u3t7eNo6mfhzE_h3ldNnberJcM79l4XefR6Z_NI56aZ3lqnuQBj_z08h8_vRzF08NhOOJzcXi5fB4-f_hjc8n4_qut-VhIO3-mmNgSZrfapL-DXYudH-jqX92icVIaV4MCgAKV5YDIfq0UPm62KLCcHBIByroqUHJlrWi5EbWFtuhY0GZygeImkD_n0fajdykT0FMw74sJaaIQb8dI-q9yxvf_1E40LoNJV77v2Hmi98TWr8dDgELxkkv2qvF3AAAA__-7H83s ) is a fifth-generation family business, that has evolved into four divisions: Shipping, Logistics, Seafoods and Industrial Services.

The acquisition will broaden the Denholm Group’s Industrial Services division capabilities and further strengthen its already large footprint across the UK. WPA will continue to operate under its established name and the management teams will remain unchanged, ensuring seamless continuity in its operations, customer relationships, and service delivery.

Simon Preston, Chief Operating Officer at the Denholm Group, said:

This acquisition is a strong strategic fit and fully aligned with our values. Our shared ambition is to grow WPA to its fullest potential. We've already identified some exciting opportunities to collaborate and we're confident that even more will emerge as we continue this journey together.

We were delighted to support the Denholm Group on its latest acquisition of WPA, a strategically important acquisition which will enhance the Denholm Group’s existing critical engineering support offerings.

48. Clarion sale receives lukewarm interest amid valuation gap

Key Points:
• HK-based PE fund FountainVest still in process
• PAI, CVC and Ardian not involved, sources say
• Suitor valuations range from GBP 1.6bn to GBP 2bn

Details:
Blackstone-backed events business Clarion has drawn tepid interest from potential private equity buyers, with some questioning the sellside’s valuation expectations, according to sources familiar with the matter.

PAI is currently not involved in the process, three sources said. CVC, which had considered teaming up with ICG, has also dropped from the process, two further sources said. Ardian had looked at teaming up with another sponsor, but didn’t submit a bid either, one source said.

Those three parties, alongside KKR and Hillhouse, were among the sponsors that had reportedly ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1v4zgM_TXWzQFFfTg66JA0m24XaPbiHpKbLNGNWsf2SnK37a8fJB0MOoe5ECDBx_ceHp1fUsxPmdJDsGq7VSg3WK-3m10tJUBt7nam5rjlCte8gbVmbp6H6F2J02jHqcT-Z5OZT7FQiu5vl89WSA9N53loetGsVWg09KpxGiR2suOG-WUoS6K7KZClsb7fsmADiE6zEPPsij9T2LlCFgFVDbpG0YKuxEbJW1kJKU6MLG8UaM21kYzGNzvEN2Jnyw2iIs4FgpGcekOBB0M99D0PXd-zeLsLGgVoJZVcSYOgRL92wnQNF6KScKH0TOni0iuVlZ8uLOaWcrG9GzKxwZ5LmXMlNhXuK9z_th2n0Y1u-CjR5yu0wr2fxkJjqXDPASRKjdBUYp-nJXmqxG6k_zO7XI0_BPtv-4Cn9kmd2kd1wKM4vfwlTi9H-Xh_GI74xA8vr5-Hz3_isX2txO4L1n7MZEN8plzYnKaw-GK_i7oO-zjQNWnToQtKuWBAAwBH7QUgsv8WSh-3ADV4QQGJAJVZc1RCey874aTx0PGeJevGkCivEsXnOvvzJYZSSThTcu-zS2WkdPPOiv3FXIndH7kLXebBlau-77LrQu-FLV8vigBci0Yo9mbxRwAAAP__8LXb3g ) indicated early interest in the business.

ICG may still be active in the process, two sources said. ICG may seek to be involved as a co-investor, as previously reported ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Us1u2zwQfBrxJmO5_JF04MGOP-dLgbgX5WDfKHIVM5EllaTSOE9f2CmK9NDLArvY2ZnBrHVLDOkpUXzwRm02CuUay3qz3pZSApTN3bYpOW64wppXUGtm53kIzuYwjWaccuh_N4m5GDLFYP-36WSEdFB1jvuqF1WtfKWhV5XVILGTHW-YW4a8RLqbPBkay_sN88aD6DTzIc02uxP5rc1kEFCVoEsULehCrJW8lZWQ4sjI8EqB1lw3ktH4ZobwRuxkeCWVdSR7ql2nCWqH2ilOWoPoCYGF213QKEArqeRKNghK9LUVTVdxIQoJZ4rPFM82vlJeuenMQmopZdPbIREbzCnnORViXeCuwN1f22Ea7WiHSw4uXaEF7tw0ZhpzgTsOIJEL1WAhdmlaoqNCbEf6mdj5avzBm-_tAx7bJ3VsH9UeD-L48p84vhzk4_1-OOAT37-8fuw_voVD-1qI7SesvcxkfHimlNkcJ7-4bL6Kug77MNA16aZD65WyvgENABy1E4DIfiwUL7cANThBHokAVVNzVEI7JzthZeOg4z2Lxo4-UlpFCs9lcqdz8LmQcKJo32cb80jx5p1l84e5ENt_cmc6z4PNV31fZZeZ3jNbPl8UAbgWlVDszeCvAAAA__-mc9ur ) by the news service.

Hong Kong-based FountainVest is also still in the process, driven perhaps by its interest in Clarion’s exposure to China, two sources noted.

The sellside, which is advised by Goldman Sachs, expected non-binding bids to be submitted early this week, two sources said. However, bids were still being received mid-week, one of them added.

Some participants have been reaching out to the sellside this week but have yet to receive a process update, two sources said.

According to two of the sources, some potential suitors were valuing the business at an enterprise value of around GBP 1.6bn-GBP 1.75bn – well below the GBP 2bn that the sellside was reportedly targeting. Some bids may still have been submitted around the GBP 2bn mark, though, a separate source noted.

Clarion has been marketed off a 2025 EBITDA in the region of GBP 170m, one source said.

The events organiser generated around GBP 430m in revenue in the fiscal year ending 31 January 2024, according ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0UstuKjkQ_Zr2rlG5_Gh64QWEIZORwmzIAnZuuxoc-nVtNwr5-itIdJXN3Viy5fOoc8q6OYb0lii-eKPWa4VyheVyvdqUUgKU9dOmLjmuucIlr2CpmZ2mLjibwziYYcyh_b4k5mLIFIP916azEdJB1Tjuq1ZUS-UrDa2qrAaJjWx4zdzc5TnS0-jJ0FA-r5k3HkSjmQ9pstmdyW9sJoOAqgRdotiDLsRKycexEFIcGRleKdCa61oyGq6mC1diZ8PBOr3kaEF7rIBrjVhRU3mvXVNVjoUHL2gUoJVUciFrBCXapRV1U3EhCgk9xRPF3sYL5YUbexbSnlI2re0Ssc6cc55SIVYFbgvctmHwpR18OU_eZroDJjvcyjC0Y-wfGS0SxWtwtDiN18V8KXD7_anALYcapKzhwdSF4VSeQ8pjvLH-HsaLN__vX_C4f1PH_ava4UEc3_8Rx_eDfH3edQd847v3y-fu879w2F8KsfmC7W8TGR9OlDKb4uhnl83Pse6Pbejo3n7doPVKWV-DBgCO2glAZL9mirdHqRqcII9EgKpeclRCOycbYWXtoOEti8YOPlJaRAqnMrlzH3wuJJwp2o_JxjxQTI8os_mjXIjNX7Uz9VNn893fT9tlpo_M5q-1RQCuRSUUuxr8HQAA__8zxeNL ) to its most recent Companies House filing. This compared to around GBP 257m in the previous 12 months.

Asia made up around 36% of the group’s revenue in the year to January 2024, followed by the US with 35%. The remaining 28% was generated out of Europe, the filing shows. A year earlier, the Asia portion was just 23% while the US accounted for 44% of the top line.

Some potential bidders voiced concerns over Clarion’s exposure to China, as well as broader geopolitical trends such as economic de-globalisation and rising conflict, which they believe may dampen demand for international business travel, one source said.

Blackstone, PAI, CVC and ICG declined to comment. Goldman Sachs, Clarion and FountainVest did not respond to requests for comments.

49. NPM Capital in exclusivity with Elbfrost as auction of wholesale fast food distributor nears end

Key Points:
• NPM beats out rivals FSN, A&M in competitive auction
• Discussions for c.5x unitranche financing package ongoing

Details:
NPM Capital is in exclusivity to acquire Elbfrost, a German frozen food distributor and wholesaler, from current owner Bencis Capital, two sources familiar with the situation said.

The Netherlands-based sponsor has edged past a handful of other private equity firms, including FSN and Alvarez & Marsal Capital (A&M), becoming the frontrunner for the asset in a competitive auction, the first source and a third source familiar said.

Earlier this month, this news service reported ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0kjFv2zAQhX-NuMk43pGUNXCw4zpNgbiLMtgbRZ5iJrKkUnQa59cXdooiSxcCPODd-x7eOX9OcX6aOT0Eq9drjWqF5XK92pRKAZT13aYuJa6lxqWsYGmEm6Y-epfjONhhzLH7-5mFTzFziu67m4-WlIeq9TJUHVVLHSoDna6cAYWtamUt_LnP58R3Y2DLQ3m_FsEGoNaIEOfJZX_ksHGZLQLqEkyJ1IApaKXV7VmQooNgKysNxkhTK8HDm-3jG4ujldhJKQM5AF0x6JqkZAiy7rjzTnYi3vaCQQKjlVYLVSNo6paO6raSRIWCE6dnTieXXjkv_HgScW54zrZz_cyit8ecp7mgVYHbAreB2_w7Jl7EcXCD6y85-vkqK3DrxyHzkAvcSgCFWlWaxOka8iHYn80DHponfWge9Q73dHj5RoeXvXq83_V7fJK7l9eP3cePuG9eC9p8yprLxDbEZ56zmNIYzj7br7jXYRd7vrZat-iC1i7UYABAovEEiOLXmdPlVpYBTxyQGVDXS4majPeqJadqD63sRLJuCInnReL4XM7-eIohFwqOnNz75FIeON2yimz_ORe0-a935tPUu3zl-4pdZn7P4vx5jgggDVWkxZvFPwEAAP__YHfUMA ) that NPM was among a handful of late-stage bidders, including FSN and IK Partners, circling the firm ahead of confirmatory offers. Sellside advisor Harris Williams is marketing the business off EUR 17m–EUR 19m in EBITDA for 2024, as reported.

NPM is in discussions with private credit firms to procure unitranche financing for its acquisition of Elbfrost, the first two sources said. The sponsor is looking to line up two or three debt funds for buyout financing, the first source added.

Lenders are offering to lever the firm at around or slightly above 5x EBITDA, although some private credit providers are pitching debt packages in the 4.5x–4.75x range, the first source said. This implies a debt package of up to EUR 85m–EUR 95m based off the marketed EBITDA.

Pricing for the unitranche could land at around 500bps over the reference rate, the first source added.

While not the most interesting company with its focus on frozen food, financiers generally see Elbfrost as a great lending case due to its size, stability and reliable cashflows, the first source said.

The firm also posts decent margins of around 13% and has a sticky customer base of institutions like hospitals and cafeterias, as reported ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0UsFu4zoM_Brr5oAiJdk-6JA0L319QPMu7iG5yRLdqHVsr6x02379Iuli0cteCJDAcGY4dP6S4vK0cHoIVm82GtUay3qz3pZKAZTN3bYpJW6kxlpWUBvh5nmI3uU4jXaccux_N4vwKWZO0f3rlpMl5aHqvAxVT1WtQ2Wg15UzoLBTnWyEvwz5kvhuCmx5LO83ItgA1BkR4jK77E8cti6zRUBdgimRWjAFrbW6lRUpOgq2stJgjDSNEjy-2SG-sTjZYCioYKgGT6y91kja9VJXDKCpBhFve8EggdFKq5VqEDT1taOmqyRRoeDM6ZnT2aVXzis_nUVcWl6y7d2wsBjsKed5KWhd4K7AXeAu_4yJV3Ea3eiGjxz9coUVuPPTmHnMBe4kgEIFDRpxvpp8CPb_9gGP7ZM-to96jwc6vvxDx5eDerzfDwd8kvuX18_953_x0L4WtP2CtR8z2xCfecliTlO4-Gy_y70O-zjwNdWmQxe0dqEBAwASjSdAFD8unD5uYZnrlQIyA-qmlqjJeK86cqrx0MleJOvGkHhZJY7P5eJP5xhyoeDEyb3PLuWR082ryPYPc0Hbv3JnPs-Dy1d932WXmd-zuHy9IwJIQxVp8WbxVwAAAP__kYvTsA ) . Some financiers declined the credit, however, as the business is somewhat commoditised with its lack of branded products and a clear-cut USP (unique selling proposition), the third source said.

Bencis has been invested in Elbfrost since 2022, according to its website. Elbfrost is a food wholesaler and logistics provider specialising in frozen products for commercial kitchens, including caterers, business canteens, hospitals, care centres and educational institutions. It operates across three sites in Germany and has a product portfolio including vegetables, chicken, fish and convenience food.

FSN declined to comment. NPM Capital, A&M, Harris Williams, Bencis Capital and Elbfrost did not respond to requests for comment.

Other funds were pitching leverage of around 4.25x–4.75x EBITDA, while bank pitches were roughly one turn lower at 3.5x–4x.

50. August Equity-backed AAB attracts sponsor, strategic interest post launch

Key Points:
• Charlesbank, GSAM, Smith & Williamson circling
• Non-binding offers due next week

Details:
Sponsors and private-equity backed strategics are expressing interest in August Equity-backed AAB after the process launched, according to sources familiar with the situation.

Non-binding offers are due next week, said one of the sources. Charlesbank and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are among the sponsors showing an interest, with Apax-owned Smith & Williamson also studying the process, said the same source plus a different source.

Lee Equity-backed Cooper Parry has also shown interest, according ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0UsFu4zgM_Rrr5oAiJdk-6JA0m24XaPaSHpKbLDGNWsf2Skq37dcPkg4GncNcCJDg43sPj85fUsxPmdNDsHq10qiWWLer5bpWCqDu7tZdLXElNbaygdYIN89D9K7EabTjVOLxZ5OFT7Fwiu5vl0-WlIem9zI0R2paHRoDR904Awp71ctO-MtQLonvpsCWx_p-JYINQL0RIebZFX_isHaFLQLqGkyNtANT0VKrW1mQooNgKxsNxkjTKcHjmx3iG4uTDR6MdJ1rDJi-Dy64XrfQgNekMXgU8XYXDBIYrbRaqA5B07F11PWNJKoUnDk9czq79Mpl4aeziHnHudijGzKLwZ5KmXNFywo3FW5-247T6EY3fJTo8xVa4cZPY-GxVLiRAApJEbQVbfJ0SZ4rWo_8fxbnq_GHYP_dPeBh96QPu0e9xT0dXv6iw8tePd5vhz0-ye3L6-f285-4371WtP6C7T5mtiE-cy5iTlO4-GK_i7oOj3Hga9Jdjy5o7UIHBgAkGk-AKP67cPq4BWjAEwdkBtRdK1GT8V715FTnoZdHkawbQ-K8SByf6-xP5xhKpeDEyb3PLpWR0827KPYXc0XrP3IXPs-DK1d932XXhd-LuHy9KAJIQw1p8WbxRwAAAP__2Ozbxg ) to an earlier report. Should either of the strategics bid, they could price more aggressively due to potential synergies, due to the bolt-on nature of the deal, one of the sources said.

AAB is expected to generate an EBITDA of GBP 20m for FY25, said one of the sources.

For the year ended March 2024, the group generated EBITDA before non-recurring costs of GBP 10.3m and GBP 6.6m after non-recurring costs, according to its most recent financial reports.

52. BT’s break-up option, Stora Enso considers forestry spin, Metro Bank takeover interest – Europe Morning Flash - Analysis

Key Points:
• BT Openreach separation could unlock value
• Stora Enso reviews EUR 5.8bn forestry spin
• Metro Bank shares gain after takeover report

Details:
Break-up and takeover possibilities around London-listed telco BT Group appear to be gaining traction.

Allison Kirkby, CEO of the business, indicated BT may consider a spin-off of broadband unit Openreach once it completes the roll-out of its full fibre network, potentially as early as next year, according to a Financial Times report last weekend (15 June).

While BT is not actively pursuing a spin-off of the unit, it could explore the option if Openreach’s value is not appropriately reflected in BT’s share price, Kirkby said.

The Morning Flash has been tracking takeover and break-up possibilities around BT for several years, most recently in September last year ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0Uk1z4joQ_DXWzdRo9GHroAOER15eVXgXcoCbLI1BiTFeSUCSX78F2d3KZS9TNV3V0z3T4_w5xfySKT0FqxYLhXKOdbuYL2spAWrzsDQ1xwVX2PIGWs3cNA3RuxJPox1PJfa_msx8ioVSdP-6fLBCemg6z0PTi6ZVodHQq8ZpkNjJjhvmz0M5J3o4BbI01o8LFmwA0WkWYp5c8QcKS1fIIqCqQdcoNqArMVfyXmZCih0jyxsFWnNtJKPxYod4IXawCqXxElqnBVetaUTXe2NabYRrVONaFu9zQaMAraSSM2kQlOhbJ0zXcCEqCUdKe0pHl96ozPzpyGLeUC62d0MmNthDKVOuxLzCVYWr6_U6C-SGRNMpFUo3RoWrOBYahrin0VOFq0uk62_UH3Od-uu1QXa8LfwU7P-bJ9xtXtRu86zWuBW713_E7nUrnx_XwxZf-Pr17XP9-V_cbt4qsfyibT4msiHuKRc2pVM4-2K_W7-BfRzolrDp0AWlXDCgAYCj9gIQ2Y8zpY97cBq8oIBEgMq0HJXQ3stOOGk8dLxnyboxJMqzRHFfZ384xlAqCQdK7n1yqYyU8v1cxf5RrsTyr9qFjtPgys3fd9t1offCzl-viQBci0YodrH4MwAA___aXNmR ) , because of a sum-of-the parts discount centred upon Openreach.

Estimates for Openreach’s value have varied widely in media reports over the past couple of years but most have pointed to a valuation higher than BT’s current market cap of GBP 19bn.

That valuation opportunity has attracted the attention of a variety of strategic investors.

Bharti Enterprises, an industrial conglomerate backed by India’s Mittal family, acquired a 24.5% stake in BT last year from French telecoms mogul Patrick Drahi.

Deutsche Telekom owns a 12% stake, a shareholding it received in part-consideration for the mobile network EE, which BT acquired for GBP 12.5bn during 2015.

And Mexican telco entrepreneur Carlos Slim upped his stake to 4%, from 3.2%, late last year.

All three investors are likely to be watching developments closely.

A prospective spin of Openreach is likely to provide a major valuation catalyst for BT and could flush out bid interest as a result.

Shares in BT closed at 191 pence yesterday (19 June), up 4% since the report on Sunday.

Stora Enso considers partial spin-off of forestry assets

Helsinki-based paper and packaging producer Stora Enso is considering a partial spin-off of its Swedish forestry assets, CEO Hans Sohlström said earlier this week via a stock exchange announcement ( https://notifications.mergermarket.com/c/eJx0U71u4zwQfBqxo7Fa_kgqWNjx53w5IL7GKeyOIlc2E1nSkbSd5OkPcg6HNNcQWII7M5gZWneJIb0kik_eqNVKoVwir1fLNZcSgDcP64aXuCoV1mUFtWZ2mvrgbA7jYIYxh-7PkJiLIVMM9n-bTkZIB1XrSl91oqqVrzR0qrIaJLayLRvmLn2-RHoYPRka-OOKeeNBtJr5kCab3Yn82mYyCKg4aI5iB7oQSyXvx0JIcWBkykqB1qVuJKPhavpwJXYySAgVWYBKla3WWnvC2nusUbaygYaFOy5oFKCVVHIhGwQlutqKpq1KIQoJZ4pHimcb3ygv3HhmIe0oZdPZPhHrzSnnKRViWeCmwM3tdlukPEZLQxrn5wVuaChwM9AtxfE-RzpeepvH-MHt4HkYrjSv8Eg92USpwM0sq8CNLnBzR-MzHA9DyMFmStzylKPNdAyOR7oGuvGx4yEnnm7kQzrxboyUMrcpUU48DCl44mHoxni-J8XOs7tP3vzcPeFh96IOu2e1xb04vP4nDq97-fy47ff4Um5f3z63nz_CfvdWiPXX2u5jIuPDkVJmUxz9xWXz3af5sgs9zXVqWrReKesb0ABQonYCENmvC8WPe0s0OEEeiQBVU5eohHZOtsLKxkFbdiwaO_hIaREpHHlyp3PwuZBwomjfJxvzQDHds8nmL3Mh1v_kznSeeptnfd9l80zvmV2-_gEClFpUQrGrwd8BAAD__8CmAiQ ) (18 June).

Stora Enso has kicked off a strategic review of the forestry assets, which cover approximately 1.2m hectares of forest land and had a fair value of EUR 5.8bn as of 31 March 2025.

The review is being conducted to increase shareholder value by unlocking the full potential of both its forestry and industrial packaging assets.

A break-up might also put Stora Enso in the takeover spotlight in an actively consolidating packaging sector.

Stora Enso plans to provide an update on the strategic review by the end of 2025.

Its R shares gained about 15% over the last couple of days following the announcement and closed at EUR 9.70 for a total market cap of EUR 7.7bn.

Metro Bank shares spike after reported Pollen Street interest

Could London-listed Metro Bank become the next takeover target in an ongoing consolidation of banks across the UK and Europe?

Shares in the lender spiked as much as 18% on Monday (16 June) to 133 pence following a Sky News report that it had received a takeover approach from financial sponsor Pollen Street Capital.

Metro Bank’s stock price pared some of those gains later in the week to close yesterday at 126 pence for a market cap of GBP 847m, up 12% on the week through Thursday’s close.

Key Points:

• Binding proposals due early July, extension possible
• Etihad drops out despite European expansion interest

Details:
Etihad Airways has dropped out of the bidding for a stake in Spain-based Air Europa, El Economista reported citing unnamed market sources.

The UAE national airline, which in the initial phase was one of the favourites, has decided not to go ahead despite its interest in expanding to the European continent, the sources said.

Following this exit, the process is now down to three contenders: Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Turkish Airlines, which are reportedly finalising their bids to take over part of the Spanish airline's capital, the item said.

The deadline for the submission of their binding proposals is early July, although an extension is not ruled out, the report said.

• Evaluating growth opportunities and partnership synergies with Air Europa
• Air Europa valued at EUR 1bn by owner Globalia Group

Turk Hava Yollari AO (Turkish Airlines/THY) has confirmed that it is interested in the Spain-based Air Europa Holding S.L.U., and that it is holding non-binding talks to invest in the company.

There have been media reports stating that Turk Hava Yollari A.O. ("the Company") is in discussions to acquire shares in Spain-based Air Europa Holding S.L.U. ("Air Europa").

55. OPTrust suspends Globalvia sale - report (translated)

Key Points:
• Indicative offers from GIC, Vauban, Igneo, GIP fell short of OPTrust's expectations
• Changes to shareholder rights requested by bidders for binding proposals
• Globalvia valued at EUR 3bn, OPTrust's stake worth over EUR 1.2bn

Details:
OPTrust has suspended the sale of its 40.32% stake in Spanish infrastructure and mobility operator Globalvia, El Economista reported, citing knowledgeable sources.

The Canadian pension fund has decided to halt the process due to the gap between its financial expectations and the indicative offers made at the end of March by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, the French fund Vauban, the Australian fund Igneo and the US fund GIP (BlackRock), the item said.

Additionally, the funds required changes to certain rights, including pre-emptive acquisition rights, held by Globalvia's other two shareholders, PGGM and USS, to ratify their interest in binding proposals, the report said

The initial market valuation of Globalvia is close to EUR 3bn, including debt, so OPTrust's shares would reach a price of over EUR 1.2bn, the report added.
